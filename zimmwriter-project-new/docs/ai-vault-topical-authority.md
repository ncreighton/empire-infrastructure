## What Is Topical Authority?

Topical authority measures how well a website understands a specific subject. It benefits SEO by helping search engines recognize website expertise and rank content for related keywords across multiple queries.

## Building Topical Authority

Foundational approaches:

- Develop comprehensive content strategy
- Organize content into topic clusters
- Align content with user search intent
- Acquire high-quality backlinks
- Create pillar pages covering broad topics
- Develop subtopic pages addressing specific angles
- Implement strategic internal linking between pages

## ZimmWriter's Generation System

### Functionality

The tool transforms broad concepts into topical clusters, each with associated long-tail keywords and blog post titles, plus auto-generated categories.

### Technical Specifications

- Maximum 20 topical clusters per generation
- Up to 20 long-tail keywords per cluster (400 maximum total)
- Dynamic blog title limits, capped at 1,000 titles overall
- Estimated costs: "$0.20 for 1,000 titles using GPT 3.5 Turbo; approximately $4.50 with GPT-4"

### Title Generation Features

Titles categorize by type:
- Listicles
- How-to guides
- Why-focused content
- Headline variations

GPT-4 generally follows prompts more precisely, though GPT 3.5 Turbo produces satisfactory results.

## Implementation Variables

- `{category=}` - Auto-creates WordPress categories and assigns posts
- `{outline_focus=}` - Clarifies ambiguous titles for relevant outline generation

## User Recommendations

Users should expect title overlap within datasets. Treat generated titles as options rather than unique article ideas. Test configurations using 3 clusters, 3 keywords, 3 titles with GPT 3.5 Turbo for cost-effective validation before scaling.
