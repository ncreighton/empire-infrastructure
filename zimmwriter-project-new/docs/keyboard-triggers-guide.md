## Overview

ZimmWriter offers keyboard trigger features enabling AI assistance across thousands of desktop applications and millions of websites through customizable keyboard shortcuts.

## Main Keyboard Triggers

### Magic Command (CTRL+1)

Users highlight text containing questions or instructions and activate this trigger. The tool processes the text through AI.

**Notable feature**: Typing `summarize=` followed by a URL allows ZimmWriter to visit webpages, read up to 10,000 words, and condense them to approximately 1,000 words at minimal cost (~2 cents).

### Continue Writing (CTRL+2)

Highlight a paragraph or two and press CTRL+2. ZimmWriter will then seamlessly continue writing, elaborating on the selected idea.

- Selecting 2-3 paragraphs yields best results
- More content produces condensed output

### Rewrite (CTRL+3)

Select text and activate this trigger to generate alternative versions.

- Recommend limiting selections to 2-3 paragraphs to avoid over-condensation

## Advanced Features

### Background Information

Users can store approximately 1,000 words of contextual details influencing AI outputs across all keyboard triggers. Saved information persists via dedicated buttons for quick access.

### Custom Commands (CTRL+4, 5, 6)

Users can map up to three personalized magic commands to these triggers.

**Example command**: "Rewrite the text to improve the grammar. Add contractions. Write using an active tone of voice."

### URL Scraping Option

Magic commands can disable automatic URL scraping when users prefer non-scraping applications.

### Settings Persistence

The "Use Settings When Menu is Closed" option maintains configurations while minimizing windows, enabling distraction-free workflows.
