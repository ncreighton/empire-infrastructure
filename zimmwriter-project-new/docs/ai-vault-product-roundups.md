# ZimmWriter Product Roundups Guide: Key Features & Settings

> Source: https://www.rankingtactics.com/zimmwriter-product-roundups/

## Core Functionality

ZimmWriter enables bulk creation of product roundup articles (3-15 products per post) that include product photos, affiliate links, reviews, pros/cons, buying guides, and optional FAQs. Users can generate up to 100 roundups simultaneously and publish directly to WordPress.

## Essential Prerequisites

- A scraping API key (DataForSEO or ScrapeOwl) for accessing protected sites like Amazon
- Optional: AAWP or AFFI license for better Amazon Terms of Service compliance
- Products can source from any website, not limited to Amazon

## Critical Configuration Settings

### Product Input Format

Users enter plural product names followed by multiple URLs (up to 20 per product) on separate lines. ZimmWriter can auto-fetch Amazon URLs by searching provided product names, allowing users to validate results before proceeding.

### Product Count Options

Three selection methods:
- **Random** (3-15 per product)
- **Set by URL quantity**
- **User-specified number**

This controls how many URLs contribute to each product review.

### Advanced Ordering Strategy

The "Randomize Product Order" feature enables sophisticated content multiplication. Users can duplicate a single product's 15 URLs up to 50 times, replacing the product name with different long-tail keywords (discovered via SEO tools). This generates 50 unique articles using identical products but different contextual angles -- "gaming laptops for college" versus "gaming laptops for work," etc.

## Content Customization Options

### Voice Settings
Separate voice choices for article structure (intro/conclusion) versus product reviews prevent awkward brand impersonation in reviews.

### Literary Devices
Randomly applies 500 variations of metaphors, similes, alliteration, personification, and other rhetorical techniques.

### Key Takeaways
Automatically identifies and highlights main points at article top.

### AI Word Removal
Eliminates specified artificial-sounding phrases from customizable blacklists.

### Readability Features
Bold formatting emphasizes skimmable content; "search intent intros" summarize entire articles in single paragraphs.

### FAQ Generation
Produces five Q&A pairs with short or long-form answers.

### Style Emulation
Articles adopt writing patterns associated with specified personas or reading levels.

## Advanced Features

### Black Tie Mode
Premium setting that generates professional-quality articles with optimized formatting and strategic image placement. Example article produced for approximately $0.02.

### Scraping Cache Management
Automatically stores 5,000 previously scraped pages; users can override for fresh scrapes when needed.

### Conclusion Toggle
Option to disable conclusion sections entirely.

## Tips

- Use Notepad++ for backup/editing product data
- Combining long-tail keyword research with URL randomization creates efficient, large-scale content production workflows
