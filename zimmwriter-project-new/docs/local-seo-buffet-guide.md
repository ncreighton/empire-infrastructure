## Overview

The Local SEO Buffet is ZimmWriter's content generation tool designed to create massive volumes of location and service-specific pages for local businesses. A business offering 25 services across 25 locations could generate up to 625 unique pages automatically.

## Core Input Fields

### Business Type
Category classification (e.g., "cleaning service," "family law," "lawn mowing service").

### Business Name
Company identifier, optionally including legal designations like LLC.

### Business Highlights
Key differentiators such as experience level, guarantees, or review counts. Users can paste multiple highlights from clipboard, with each highlight on a separate line.

### Service Locations
Geographic areas served (recommended minimum 5). Format: city and state. Users may include location background information preceded by a minus sign.

### Services Offered
Individual service listings with optional Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) and 1-3 benefits per USP. The system allows clipboard paste functionality with services on separate lines.

## Advanced Configuration Options

### Literary Devices
Enabling this feature randomly applies 500+ variations of literary techniques to generated content:
- Metaphor
- Simile
- Alliteration
- Personification
- Hyperbole
- Onomatopoeia
- Irony
- Foreshadowing
- Symbolism
- Allusion

### Boost Detection as Real
Legacy option for bypassing AI detectors; functionality diminished with modern detection tools.

### Voice Selection
- **First Person Plural** (We, Us, Our)
- **First Person Singular** (I, Me, My)
- **Second Person** (You, Your)
- **Third Person** (He, She, They)
- **Professional** (minimal personal pronouns)

### Language Settings
Input must remain 100% English for optimal output quality. Non-English language selection available for output, though quality varies.

### AI Model Selection
- **GPT 3.5 Turbo:** ~$0.002 per 300-700 words (most economical)
- **Davinci (GPT 3.5):** ~$0.02 per equivalent (broader vocabulary)
- **GPT-4:** ~$0.03 input + $0.06 output (3x Davinci cost; requires API waitlist approval)

## Key Strategic Elements

### USP Framework
Rather than generic service descriptions, users define proprietary features with measurable benefits. Example: "Power Dry" technology providing faster drying times, reduced bacterial growth, and quicker furniture repositioning.

### Content Customization
Generated content files contain multiple variations for each service-location combination, allowing manual selection rather than using all content wholesale -- hence the "buffet" metaphor.

### Scalability
Solves the fundamental problem of local SEO optimization requiring unique pages per service-location combination without manual writing burden.
