# Create a Topical Authority Spreadsheet with 1000 Blog Post Titles in 1-Click!

this spreadsheet right here has over a thousand different blog post titles a thousand different blog post titles and I generated it using AI by simply typing in the phrase college life I typed in the phrase college life in the AI generated 10 different topical clusters about college life classes social activities dorm life academic pressure study habits all that stuff and then for each of those topical clusters it generated 10 different longtail keywords and then for each of those longtail keywords it generated 10 different blog post titles a thousand blog post titles by simply typing in the phrase college life not only did it do all that it created 10 different categories for our WordPress website and then if we paste in this merged list at the end of the spreadsheet Zim writer the AI writing software will write the article for us it will upload the article to Wordpress it will create the category if the category does not exist it will index the article in the category and then you're done so theoretically you could type in one phrase and create an entire website without any more work that's pretty cool now I do recommend editing your articles I I strongly recommend that but if you really did want to create a website by just clicking a couple buttons you can now do that with Zim writer let me demonstrate how it all works so in Zim writer there's a new feature called AI Vault the AI vault is a place where we're going to store all the extra features that kind of don't belong anywhere else and in it you'll see this button called activate topical Authority generator I don't know if you've ever heard the word topical Authority but topical Authority is really important in the world of SEO if you are a Blog about dogs how to care for a dog and you write an article about how to invest in your kids college fund you're probably not going to rank because you're not an authority on investing you're an authority on dogs so it's important to build that topical Authority up now there's lots of courses and lots of literature and what topical Authority means and whatnot but I'm I'm going to skip all that I just want to give that high level overview on what topical Authority is and this solution that Zim riter creates isn't meant to be the end all Beall of topical Authority generation but it's meant to be a really cool tool that you can get a lot of use out of so we'll click the button and you'll see the menu in here and it will ask for a broad concept now the broad concept is usually going to be more than one word you can put the five different words in here and you want to give the AI some direction this is going to be your Niche or your sub Niche so if your Niche is how to care for a dog all right maybe this broad concept could be washing a dog or washing your cat or something like that in this example I will do Donald Trump trump then you want to set some limits so how many topical clusters do we want how many long Tales do we want and how many blog post titles do we want now realize that you'll get three log post titles for each long tail and you'll get three longtails for each topical cluster so you're going to get 27 different blog titles with this setting here if we come down here and we say 10 different topical clusters we're going to get 90 blog post titles it's going to take longer to generate a higher number if you put in 10 and 10 you'll get a thousand different blog post titles this will take a couple minutes now using turbo this will cost roughly for a th000 every blog post titles roughly 20 cents gp4 is a little bit more expensive this is going to be about $4 $5 to do a thousand different blog post titles so just don't be surprised just be aware of what the pricing is we'll just do three of each and then we'll click create topical Authority CSV you'll see it working down here and we'll open this up and you'll eventually see this Donald Trump CSV generated inside of here now while that's working let me explain some stuff we were looking at college life so this example was using turbo and as you can see the cost was was 20 cents I also did college life using gp4 now this was let's make this a little bit bigger all right now this was $4 about 50 little bit more expensive but when we're talking about creating a topical Authority topical map around a particular Niche four or five bucks is really a drop in the bucket when it's all said and done so let's before we talk about these let's look at the D Trump one because we just generated that so this is the CSV let's format the cells real quick I'll make this a little bit bigger all right so remember we said give us three clusters so politics presidency controversies now just so you know this does not go out and scrape the internet this is all AI based eventually I might build some different Ser scraping and stuff like that in here but right now this is all just AI based so these are our clusters now for each cluster we have different longtails so for politics we have Donald Trump impeachment trial Trump Administration policies Trump campaign controversies and you'll see for each one of these we have a different blog post title and there's this little type column right here what this is there is different blog post types there's FAQ posts there's uh why posts listicle posts howto posts you'll also see some stuff called psychology which there's different like psychological ways to make a blog post title so if you see one of these pop up it's using one of the random psychological ways to make a blog post title there's also a headline hack but I don't see that in here that's in let's find one over here headline hack there's some different headline hacks that we can make too that you'll eventually see pulled in now you'll also see this category over here the category is similar to the topical cluster it's not always identical but it's over here and you'll also see this outline Focus the outline focus is a cool feature that's already existing inside a zim riter and you can put it in adjacent to your title so this is a merged column with our category and our outline Focus so you could theor theoretically take this and go over to Zim writer and open up the bulk writer and paste this whole thing in so we have our title for the article unveiling the truth inside Donald Trump's impeachment trial the category if we leave this in here it's going to create the category politics if it doesn't already exist and it's going to assign it to the category politics now our outline focus is going to give the AI some direction on what the article is going to be about as it writes just the outline just that outline that you want written that's important because sometimes these titles are amorphous to the AI let's see if I can find one so this is a great example six key policies shaping the future under current Administration that's a very amorphous title it doesn't mention Donald Trump in there so the outline Focus says the context text for the numeric list the numeric list is this outline that the AI is going to create is Trump Administration policies for the topic of politics in the context of Donald Trump so when you put this outline focus in with your blog post title you'll get something that will actually uh be on point to this particular article title right here now if you use a custom outline your mileage is going to vary but if you don't use a custom outline you'll get much better results using that that outline Focus now the other thing I want to talk about and this is the more important matter why is there such a difference in price between gp4 and GPT 3.5 GPT 3.5 is 20 GPT 4 is $4.50 for some people that's a lot of money is it really worth using GPT 4 over over GPT 3.5 turbo well one of the differences is gp4 is just more expensive than GPT 3.5 turbo but even though it's more expensive sometimes it's worth it because its knowledge based its brain so to speak is larger than turbo and it also follows directions a lot better so I put these side by side turbo on my left gp4s on the right and let me try to see if I can demonstrate this and and realize too we do get different topical clusters so we have academic studies here and that could probably be the same as classes is one right and one wrong not necessarily we have classes social activities we have academic studies we have dormatory living we have dorm life over here so there is a lot of similarities but let's go over and look at the actual types because that's where you'll really see the difference between gp4 and 3.5 here's a Yost right here all right six gamechanging college classes for non-traditional students and the category is classes college classes for non-traditional students so six gamechanging college classes for non-traditional students but it's a y post this is a good blog post title nothing wrong with it but a y post over here would often have the word why at the beginning of it why college students swear by these study techniques so it's not to say that this stuff is wrong over here but the AI will better follow the prompting behind the scenes for these types of posts when you're using GPT 4 over GPT 3.5 so in my opinion if money is not a big issue for you and paying for five bucks for a thousand different blog post titles isn't really a big deal then use the gp4 because you'll get a better variety of blog post titles than you will with GPT 3.5 the other thing that you might be wondering is do you need to generate a thousand different blog post titles like what settings should we use over here when we generate this because you don't technically have to we can go over here and say we want 10 topical clusters to build that Authority and we want 10 different longtails but let's do three different blog post titles you know that's perfectly fine realize that the blog post titles there will be some overlap for a particular longtail so here's our longtail right here effective study techniques for college students so 15 proven study techniques for college students all right and then here we go Cutting Edge College Study strategies worth testing now there's some overlap between both of these articles should you write both of these articles I don't know that's going to be up to you but there might be some overlap within the longtails so you can think about the topical cluster and the long tail as ways to really build that Authority and then the blog post title section as different options to choose from maybe you won't write all of these maybe you'll say you know what we don't want this one and maybe we don't want this one but we want these so you can go through here and curate your own list so what you can do so we've deleted these sections but you really want to delete Del the merg stuff too over here if you're going to end up pasting this whole thing in to the bulk writer so you can just delete this whole row right here and that will clear it out for you so again you don't have to pick every single one inside of a particular section pick the ones you want and that kind of goes back to here you don't necessarily have to generate 10 different blog post titles maybe you want to use GPT 4 but you want to save a couple bucks and you don't really need 10 so you're only going to use five so you play around with this in my opinion if you want to just explore things and and see if there is some good AI recommendations for your different broad concept start out with three that's the default start out with three start out with turbo and kind of see what the AI gives you if it's giving you some good topical clusters and you also might want to narrow stuff down a little bit so here our broad concept was college life but maybe you want to say you know what I want to kind of Niche down to dormatory living and college life so let's do something like that let's go over here and we'll say three longtails one block post title we'll say dorm living at college so we've niched down a little bit we'll generate the Clusters real quick so you don't have to just use what you get here you can explore this a little bit and say oh you know what it's coming up with some really good stuff that I didn't think about some really good ways to Niche down some other different talking points heck you don't even have to feed this stuff into Zim writer you maybe you have another AI writer that you want to use so really think outside the box with this there's a Myriad of use cases for this so we Niche down to dorm living at College let's see what the CSV looks like I'll make this a little bigger and we'll auto fit so dorm living at college so benefits of dorm living so that could be a topical cluster challenges of dorm living tips for successful dorm living experiences all right so here's the long taale enhanced social experience in dorm in college dorms convenient access to campus amenities to disc discover the ultimate dorm living benefit 10 ways to supercharge your college dorm social life so you're like you know what I like this I like what it's giving me I like this little niche I want to focus on that Niche and so you what you'll go over here you'll go back and you'll put in like dorm living at college and you'll say now I want to do the full 10,000 different blog posts titles so pretty cool stuff
