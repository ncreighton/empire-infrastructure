# Scraping Surgeon Unpacked (Amazon and AppSumo Examples)

hey I want to share with you this brand new feature inside of zimmerer called scraping surgeon and it's going to give you power that you've never had before and this is insane power this is this is like uh like Marvel superhero Thor Infinity Gauntlet power this is very powerful I'm going to demonstrate it for you but I kind of want to give you that high level overview first on what this is and why it's important so if you don't know what Zim wrer is it's in my opinion because I made it the world's best AI writing software if you don't have a license there's link down below definitely check it out now there's a lot of places inside of Zim writer that we can have the AI use content from the internet to seed its brain and then write about it so as an example Penny Arcade we can put up to a thousand URLs in here have the AI write you put in videos it will write a whole blog post based on the transcript you put in Amazon products or Amazon links it will write an entire blog post about the particular product it will use a featured image it will use call to actions it will put an affiliate tag in there all that good stuff you can put in just your competitor's URLs if you want to you can put in your own URLs and you want to you can put in any kind of URL you can think of in here and for every URL you put in up to a th Zim writer will write a blog post for you so that's one place that you can have the AI go to the Internet retrieve data and then manipulate it somehow you can also do that inside of the SEO writer so inside of here you can put for each of your headings a URL and so a lot of people will use this for writing a Roundup post maybe you want to do 10 best barbecue grills for 2023 you can do that you can put in 10 different URLs for Amazon in here and easily and quickly write a very high quality product Roundup review another place you can use this is in the bulk writer you can click on this SEO CSV and upload a CSV file with thousands of different blog posts with background information inside of them different URLs that you want the AI to go out and scrape so a lot of different ways to use it the last place that you can use that is inside of like a notepad or an editor or something like that you can type in summarize and then an equal sign and then pull a URL so I have this Juice Box thing that I bought from my son oops so I highlight it all I hit control one I'll let it summarize bought these juice boxes for my son they're pretty good actually but I pack him in his lunch and uh we can have the AI write a summary about this but one of the problems is all these different places that we can have the AI summarized data from the internet one of the big problems is in some of these situations some of these Pages like Amazon Pages for instance there's a lot of extraneous information stuff that we don't really need so on this page we have the title of the product the photo some details but then we have like energy drinks I'm not feeding my kid an energy drink he's in sixth grade I'm not going to give him an energy drink at school the teachers would kill me there's other drinks in here too there's more drinks so as you can see there's a lot of stuff that does not relate specifically to this product it's not about this particular product as you scroll down we have a disclaimer we have saw blades I'm not getting my kid a saw blade for his lunchbox we have a cat although my kid could use some exercise that's a cat wheel we could getting ideas now we could have them run on an exercise wheel but you get the point there's a lot of stuff on here that we don't need we just want specific things for the AI so we can have the AI summarize the data here now this summary turned out really well because we're using something called scraping surgeon so inside of Zim writer you click on the options menu and we can set up scraping surgeon now you'll need scrape out a do this and if you click on the setup scrape out you can easily set up your API key for that before we talk about how this works I want you to click on this guide up here all right we're going to go over some high level stuff right here it might go a little bit over your head depending on your technical KN how but I'm going to tell you a couple things what we're going to cover is not hard it's not hard to learn this stuff number two you learn this stuff you're going to be much more advanced than your competitors you can read all about scraping surgeon in here we give you a primer on HTML a primer on CSS we talk about how to actually use this tool so I'm going to give you that high level overview right now on how to use this but if you want more of a deep dive click this link read The Ultimate Guide so I've already loaded up Amazon for you download Zim writer you'll have an Amazon profile already in here already set up I can't do all the other sites because there's billions of websites out there right so I did Amazon lot of affiliate marketers out there the first thing you want to specify in here is your domain so we have Amazon dot now I could type amazon.com but there's other Amazon domains in here there's amazon.co.uk there's probably amazon.in probably there's an amazon. J JP so a lot of different Amazon domains so we're just going to go for amazon. and leave it at that that will cover everything now the first thing we need is a title okay so we got to get the CSS class or ID or the HTML tag H1 or H2 for the title of the product so this is the title of the product now what you can do if you've never done this before this is going to be either scary or eye openening if you're in Chrome you can press F12 that will open up this HTML console that shows you all the different HTML on the page there's a little arrow up here we can press it and then highlight or I guess move I'm not actually holding the mouse down we just move the mouse over the title of the product and then we click and then the HTML goes to where that is see as I move around the text or the Highlight on the left changes so I have a title of the product now I don't I could specify the H1 H1 usually represents the title of the product the problem is there's a lot of different H1s on this page there's 39 of them actually let's go for tags there's nine of them there's nine different H1s and this H1 has nothing to do with the title this H1 has the content unlock 5% savings so there's a lot of H1s on here that don't relate to this title so we can't use H1 that's not going to work as a tag to tell Zim writer where the title is so let's keep looking I've done my homework and I chose product title and if we look the product title is right here so it's a span that's a HTML tag and the ID is product title me put that in right here now you'll see a hashtag in front of it because and this is not Zim writer nomenclature but CSS nomenclature is when you're actually like referring to the code outside of the HTML you put a hashtag in front of the ID and if it's a class it's a class you put a period in front of it so this was a class you'd have a period here but we're going to have a hashtag here because this is an ID an ID the big difference is ID will appear one time on the page everywhere on this page this will only be one time but then a class can appear and infinite number of times so you want to try to identify things by ID if possible so we have our ID for the product and what you'd also want to check is if this ID is consistent across multiple products at Amazon because that will help give you an indication on whether or not this truly is something that Amazon uses to designate the title then we have the image now you can leave this empty if you want to if you populate it then what will happen is Zim riter when it scrapes this will actually download this image all right and resize it and all this cool stuff and then if you connect WordPress it will even upload the image either as a featured image or as an inline block image or something like that now obviously you need to pay attention to all copyright rules and whatnot if you don't understand those you're not comfortable you can just leave this blank and then handle the image yourself maybe you like to embed the URLs or maybe you like to have your own Amazon API whatever you want long story short you leave this empty it won't grab the image otherwise you can find the image so let's show you how we found this image over here now we're using image tag wrapper ID and if you remember the hashtag means that this is actually an ID so let's see if we can find it so here's a div that surrounds this image tag so we collapse this all right you can tell that the image tag is inside of this div and the ID all right IDs are good image tag wrapper ID all right sounds perfect so we're going to use that for our image then you can specify up to five CSS classes or IDs in HTML tags and these are the particular HTML tags you can choose from up to five of those comma separated to identify the different text on the page I won't go through each one of these but the long and short of it is I found text to represent the content over here and then the product details and then I've actually found that different products will have different areas down here so I've included some of those different areas you're not going to see this on every single one but this will encapsulate or Encompass most of the products on Amazon then you can put your affiliate code down here this is really simple to to enter you don't have to enter question mark tag equals all that stuff for Amazon you just put your code in here and then you have two check boxes down here treat as review and enable let's talk about this first if you leave this checked then anytime Zim writer anywhere scrapes Amazon it will use scraping surgeon and meaning it will just pull the data that we've identified here so if we disable it it won't do that anymore now treat as review what that does let's get out of here when you're in Penny Arcade and you put an Amazon Link in here and you just have a link to a product I guess I'll explain this you have just a link to a product what should the title be do we want the title just to be Arizona mucho mango drink 6.75 fluid ounces we don't want the title to be that that would be a stupid blog post title more likely than not you're writing a product review so anytime you are using scraping surgeon to let's see if I can get back to it scraping surgeon anytime you're using scraping surgeon to identify something that would be classified as a product all stuff on Amazon is going be a product then you'd want to click treat as a review and then what's going to happen is when you're using the penny arcade it's going to title the article in in the form of a review it's probably going to use the word review like Arizona mucho mango drink review or something like that if you leave this out it won't do that you don't have to just use scraping surgeon for products but if you decide to use a particular domain that has mainly products that you're going to be scraping for products probably check this if you're intending to be using it for Penny Arcade this only applies to Penny Arcade right now so let's do another one from scratch Let's Go To None clear this out and we're actually going to do appsumo if you don't know what appsumo is great place to find great deals now there's a lot of affiliate Mark marketers that advertise appsumo products they'll sign up with appsumo get an affiliate code and then just start writing reviews about these particular products let me show you how to do this very quickly so we'll click F12 write a review really quickly and again you don't necessarily want to use scraping surgeon if you're only going to use appsumo like one URL one time you'd want to take your time and set this up if you're planning on scraping this a lot so first we need our domain so we'll do app sumo.com then we need our title let's go over here now our title over here is H1 I've looked and there's really not a lot of other H1s there are a couple in here but they're all representative of the title this one actually says the title again and this one this one doesn't but I've done some tests before this video and this will work out fine so we'll put H1 in here then we want the image so let's go over here and find the image now there's a couple images in here there's a carousel we're going to go up here and let's see as I move around I'm seeing what we're capturing Carousel rapper that might not be bad oh image Carousel perfect I think now we're going to do a search for it because we're doing a class image Carousel there's only one image Carousel in this entire thing so image Carousel might actually be a good choice even though it is a class there is this to PDP section Carousel and of course they're using it twice so I don't know if that's a good thing or not let's take the class image Carousel all right we'll try it so it's a class so we do a period and we'll paste that in there then we need up to five CSS classes IDs or HTML tags and these are the choices we can choose from I've done my homework before this video and the problem on this page is that there's really not good CSS classes and IDs to identify the content on this page there's a lot of stuff that just it's it's not helpful so take a step back and think about this for a second Amazon is different than appsumo in the respect that an Amazon page will talk about a lot of different products maybe related products people also bought maybe products that are completely different like a saw blade which is completely different than than a Juice boox drink okay on appsumo though everything on this page kind of relates to this product so no matter what we pull we're really not going to pull stuff that's extraneous information so we don't have to be afraid of that so what we can do is we can just select some of this text and we'll see it's in a paragraph tag so all I'll do is put a p here now that and that's an HTML tag for paragraph I don't need a period before it I don't need a hashtag we're not doing CSS this is just HTML here we could do CSS in in classes and IDs but we're not going to do that because there's really no good ones here based on my research so we'll do par a paragraph now there's also some lists you scroll down there's some good juicy lists in here so all this stuff is good stuff but it's not paragraphs it's all in list format so let's capture that too we'll put a comma here and we'll put Li now I don't have an affiliate thing set up and that's perfectly fine we will click the treat as review box and then we're going to save this as an new domain so now appsumo is saved now there's one more thing that we need to do with appsumo based on my research as you scroll down watch what happens to the images it appeared watch we'll try it one more time it appeared trying to make this stuff magically appear a lot of these images lazy load and if you don't know what that means they don't actually load in the HTML they're not visible code until you actually scroll down the page so if you're finding that when you try to scrape a page you're not getting the data all right it's saying there's not enough information to scrape that could mean one of two things either your HTML code your CSS classes and IDs or HTML tags that you've identified are are not good choices or the domain needs either JavaScript rendering or lazy loading or possibly even premium proxies now all this stuff does cost more scrape out credits so you don't want to just put appsumo everywhere under the sun because then it could end up costing you more but I've tested it out this just needs lazy loading this is five extra credit or five credits per scrape not a big deal you got to spend money to make money but this is you get 10,000 credits for five bucks a month that's insane that's a crazy good deal all right so it's all set up now now we're going to test this out going to see if we get the the summary and also the image so I'll take this URL and I'll go to Penny Arcade and I'll paste it in here now there's a new feature inside a penny arcade called only summarize and that's going to summarize this you know however many URLs we have in here and create an article for each one not not a blog post just a file so we'll call this app Sumo watch what's going to happen now we could do summary over here summarize over here but the problem is it's not bulk number one and then number two you don't get the image you don't get to see if it's actually capturing the image in here so different use cases so here's our output folder let's wait for this to finish this is very quick too this is a very quick and efficient way to see if you're capturing the right data using your HTML and CSS IDs and tags and stuff all right so there it is appsumo 01 so it will prepend this is our job name appsumo that's what we called it and then it will say number one number two for however many URLs you put in there cool okay so we have our URL this cost us a fifth of one penny a fifth of one penny to summarize now here's the image URL let's check it out there it is looks pretty cool and then here is the summary now yeah the summary it's an AI summary it's going to vary each time but it looks like we're capturing good stuff so let's do one more thing let's actually write a blog post and have it automatically upload to my website so back to penry Arcade I'll put it in there I'm going to do 5H twos lary devices lists tables let's do the first person singular and we'll do key takeaways I want short answers Auto style we don't want an image API because I'm actually we're leaving the tag in there to pull the image again follow all copyright laws and rules and stuff like that that's on you but we'll just leave that in for the test and we'll select our WordPress site you can link up to 10 different WordPress sites inside of Zim writer and then just vary between them whenever you want and we'll set this as a draft and let's see here let's do YouTube videos I don't know if there is a sessions YouTube video but we'll try it we'll have the AI try to find one YouTube video and I think that would be it we'll click Start Penny Arcade all right what's going to happen now is here is our website when this finishes it will automatically upload right here so I'll shut up we'll let this thing run and we'll will check the result when it's done the article's done let's refresh the page and check it out all right click on preview and there it is it pulled our image sessions a comp comprehensive review of the ultimate meeting tool look at that so our table of contents now this is a plugin for WordPress it's called lucky table of contents or something it's completely free there's our key takeaways Pro so maybe I shouldn't have done a YouTube video for it because it looks like it's not totally related I can go in and just edit the the post and pull it out some of these appsumo products will be hit or miss with YouTube videos but if you're like talking about how to watch a dog or something you'd have much better luck with a relevant YouTube video this is awesome it's pulling the the details from the the license tiers and everything in-depth analysis fantastic see how easy that is to get a really really cool review done really quickly just for pennies this was actually I forgot to show you let's look at how much this cost this is the actual text document this cost me three pennies three pennies to create some of those other tools are charging you per word or something like that like 50,000 words a month for $200 this is three pennies for for 1,200 words and I don't get the money you pay open AI so very powerful tool now in Zim riter that you all have to surgically scrape data that you want it's mindblowing drop a comment down below tell me how you're using scraping surgeon I'd love to hear it uh join the Facebook group if you have not there's over 10,000 members in there who can help you come up with different setups for different domains in scraping surgeon or just give you some general advice other than that good luck with your content generation
