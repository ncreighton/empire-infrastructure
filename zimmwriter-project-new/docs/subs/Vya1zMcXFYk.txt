# Lesson 9 - Getting Started with YouTube

in this lesson I'm going to share with you all the cool ways that you can have Zim writer automatically find YouTube videos and bring them into your article as YouTube in beds to boost your page on time and then I'll also show you a cool way that you can repurpose existing YouTube videos into blog post articles let me show you how it works so I have this article we had Zim writer write five tricks to get a second date here's the first H2 Master the art of engaging conversation and here is the video that Zim riter found how to never run out of things to say keep the conversation flowing very relevant to the subheading and to the article as a whole how did we do that in the bulk writer there's a button called YouTube videos we press it you'll see this check box right here all you have to do is check that box assuming you have a scrape out account and YouTube videos will then be enabled you can select up to three YouTube videos first video is inserted at your first subheading if you select two then the first video is at the first subheading the second video is at the third subheading and if you select three you'll get a video video and then video and they take priority over AI images so if you pick AI images and YouTube videos you'll get an a YouTube video in the spot in place of an AI image so just keep that in mind so this button that works inside of the bulk writer it's also available in the penny arcade works the same way and it's also available in the SEO writer let's scroll down a little bit YouTube videos so those are three ways that you can automatically have a YouTube video found and then inserted at the the first subheading the third subheading and or the fifth subheading now maybe you want the YouTube videos inserted at different places at maybe the second subheading or maybe you have some h3s that you're creating inside of the SEO writer and you want a a YouTube video for that one can you do that you can so there's actually a tag curly brackets YT closing curly brackets and that will cause a YouTube video to appear here right there now you might also be using a custom outline we haven't talked about custom outlines in this video series yet but that's also a place for you to use YouTube uh videos so let's go to custom outlines oh I got to turn this off and then we'll pull up a custom outline where I have one saved so recipes and you'll see history all right and we have this YouTube variable right here this YT and brackets it's hard hard to see on the screen but it's in there you can read more about the custom outlines and and how you can use the YouTube variable by clicking on that Direct Link in the custom outline area and then scrolling down and it will talk about this YouTube variable and where you can use it so that's how you can have Zim riter automatically find relevant YouTube videos and then bring them into your article now the next thing you can do with YouTube videos is actually go to a YouTube video URL and then write an article based on that so I found this YouTube video here North Korea fire shells towards South border Island and we had Zim riter create a summary using the penny arcade so I just took the URL with the video I put it in here I configured some options and I said go write the article and then here is the article we got so we use some AI images North Korea's provocative artillery shelling raises tensions and then here is the article we got we now this is like an Inception moment right here this video is not the video we just summarized and then wrote an article based on this is the video that Zim riter found that's relevant to this particular title right here wrap your head around that Inception moment right there because what you can do is you can have Zim writer write an article based on a YouTube video it goes to the video summarizes the transcript writes an article based on the summary but then you can enable the YouTube video box and now you're going to insert a YouTube video into the article it's a mind explosion right there and you can also see I scrolled this is one of the AI images I love these like little North Korean soldiers and these little baby tanks absolutely love it you can actually see the summary too if you want to you can I don't want to get too deep into the woods you can do a magic command summarize equal and then summarize the YouTube video and there's actually a cache that stores the previous summaries so we've already summarized this video watch this hit control one it it just pulls it from the memory but here's the summary this is the summary that the AI Ed to then write this article mind explosion right now especially if you have a situation where you have 100 personal videos that you created yourself on YouTube that would do great as actual blog post you can do that now with AI images and pulling YouTube videos and all kinds of cool stuff really powerful things now I'm excited about it I hope you're excited about it if
