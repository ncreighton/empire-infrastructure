# Lesson 16 - Find a Bazillion Niches Using ZimmWriter

hey and welcome to your getting started
guide for the bulk nich generator inside
of Zim riter this is a very powerful
feature I built it for myself because I
was having trouble coming up with
different niches and when I first turned
it on when I first Ed it I was blown
away by it and the people I've shown it
to have been blown away by it too I
think you're going to be blown away by
it also you can generate tens hundreds
even thousands of different Niche ideas
with just the click of a button it's
really that powerful let me show you how
it works so inside of the AI Vault we'll
click on Bulk N generator and there's a
directions link up here you can click it
and read the directions but the long and
short of it is you can put in up to 200
different Niche ideas and they can be
one to five words each and you don't
have to put in 200 you can just put in
one if you want to but for each Niche
idea that you put in you'll get five
Niche ideas out and the niche ideas can
be very broad or they can be a little
bit narrow so let's do some stuff around
dogs let's investigate the dog Niche so
we'll just put dogs now you can actually
repeat this like right now we have dogs
in there one time that will give us five
different Niche ideas we can put in dogs
three times that will give us five 10 15
so 15 different Niche ideas around the
concept of dogs we can go narrow also we
can go dog care we can type in uh
vacationing with your dog dog grooming
and let's just leave it at that we'll
give this a name and we'll say dog Niche
ideas you choose the model you want the
you know the brain on gp4 is a little
bit bigger it get a little bit more
expensive but we're just going to use
3.5 turbo and we'll click create niches
this actually goes really quick so we'll
just watch it
work okay so it's already done and it
outputs a CSV file so we can close this
and you can see the CSV file over
here and we will make this a little bit
bigger and I will zoom in a little bit
so you guys can see okay so we have
153 different Niche ideas
so we put dogs in three times so we got
15 results for that so as you can see
this cost us half of a penny this entire
sheet cost just half of a penny
incredibly inexpensive so let's look at
the different Niche ideas so website one

of these the topical Authority generator
is limited to a broad concept of 20w or
less so sometimes the description might
need to be narrowed down by you a little
bit it might be over 20 words so we can
just say helping dog
owners I think that's probably under 20
and then we can say
five and watch this we can put this at
