# Amazon Affiliate Codes and ZimmWriter Call to Action Links Explained

I've had a couple people ask me how can I just add my Amazon affiliate code and as in writer and start generating Amazon reviews they're like that's all I want to do I just want to do that how do I do that let me show you because it's very easy to get up and running quickly so the first thing I want you to do is make sure you're on at least version 8.129 8.129 there's been a lot under the hood that's changed we've had some bug fixes and stuff like that so make sure you're at least on this version if you're not and you need to upgrade just click this little zimriter update button and you'll get upgraded very quickly once you've done all that you can go into the options menu now we're going to use scraping surgeon we're going to put our affiliate code in there very simple to do but you do need scrape out first if you don't have scrape out you go in here you can get the scrapal API key very easy once you get that set up then we go into scraping surgeon now a lot of this sounds really complex but for those that just want to mess with Amazon you don't need to deal with any of this stuff all you'll do is click this Amazon option down here I've pre-populated it for everybody everybody's Zoom writer has this in here and if you mess something up in here like if you you know Screw something up don't worry about it because what you can do is erase everything and load the defaults right now the only default is the Amazon website so you can press this button erase everything start over we go back in here and all of our mistakes are are fixed so you can select Amazon and then add your affiliate code in here I'm assuming you have Amazon affiliate account and you'll have to figure out where to find it I can find mine up here using site stripe and it will in this drop down you'll see all your different affiliate codes for your different websites we're just going to use this temporary one that I created we type it in right here mms034-20 that's all we have to do then we press update domain now you'll look let's close this and let's go back in here scraping surgeon if we open up the Saved Amazon profile we'll see this in here now I want to clear another issue of confusion up I've seen people do a lot now it's all set anytime zimwriter scrapes anything anywhere inside of zimwriter it will use this Amazon profile if it's an Amazon domain okay you quit zimwriter you start it back up again you don't need to go to scraping surgeon in quote unquote load this up these are already active because everybody is looking for these saved domains you can put up to 50 in here Sim writer is looking for them as it scrapes the data so you'll never need to come back in here unless your affiliate code changes or some of the code on the Amazon site changes and then I'll tell you what to do so don't worry about that now before we close this options menu there's one more configuration you can make to these call to action buttons the first thing you can do is instead of getting a button all right you can get a raw link I don't know what kind of page builder you use maybe you use Elementor or break dance or something like that and so you have your own buttons in there you don't want zoom Rider to make a button for you if that's the case you can just uncheck this and then save the options and now you won't get a button but you'll get a call to action just a link https amazon.com and then to the product and then your affiliate code but we're going to keep it as a button you can change the button text I like view latest price and then the button color this is the hex code you can change the the color to whatever you want but we're going to leave it all as the defaults now let's talk about where we can actually get that call to action how can we actually generate that in our article there's two different places the first place is inside of Penny Arcade so we'll open up Penny Arcade and we'll get this URL for Amazon and we can take the whole URL or I can take the short version it doesn't really matter Zoom writer will parse it all out we'll paste that right in there as you can see there's no affiliate tag on the end and then we simply configure some different options let's see I won't do an FAQ we'll disable conclusion now if I were to start Penny Arcade right now I would not get a call to action button why is that because the outline that's created by Penny Arcade is by the AI so the AI doesn't really know where to put a call to action like you don't want to call to action your pros and cons list or maybe right after the introduction you probably want the call to action in specific places so that's where we need to use a custom outline custom outlines and some people are confused on this they're different than like an SEO writer outline on one end of the spectrum you can have the AI come up with the entire outline all by itself on the other end you can completely define the outline in the bulk SEO CSV upload or in the SEO writer but there's some situations where you have lots of links from a domain and all of those links can follow an outline format so as an example Amazon all right whether you're reviewing a cordless drill a hand to drill a screwdriver a hammer a lawnmower all of the Articles could probably follow an outline template or an outline format let me demonstrate so in this custom outline and if you've never used custom outlines you can click this link up here and we'll open up my site and explain how to use custom outlines but I have this one I created all right and you can pause the video and copy this is very basic and there's an overview section and then a detail so this is an H2 it's going to do an overview detailed features pros and cons including thoughts and now what happens is when I enable this now it's enabled if I go to Amazon and I paste in like another product let's pretend that this is another product in here and another product each of those products are going to follow this outline for each of those products we'll get an overview section then we'll go to detailed features then we'll get pros and cons and concluding thoughts now there's some other Special Sauce that you can put in here to make it more unique to the article that you're writing about there is a an optimized title feature that I highly recommend reading about but for right now we're not going to use any of that stuff all we're going to use is this CTA tag the call to action tag so what we're going to do is I'll start with none and just put them in here we'll figure out where we want our call to action so let's put a call to action after the detailed features so I'd go to the end of this H2 element and we'll put in CTA and then I'll come down here to the end of the concluding thoughts element and I'll put curly brackets CTA okay and then I will if you're creating this from scratch you'll click save new outline otherwise if you're updating an outline you click update the outline now what's going to happen when zenwriter writes the review for each of these products it's going to have an overview section that will be an H2 a detailed feature section that will be an H2 it's going to put a call to action at the end of the detailed feature section do pros and cons and concluding thoughts so now it's all enabled and let's delete the other redundant ones and let's generate it really quick just to show you how easy this is I'll open up my WordPress site and show you that there's no post on there yet and we'll just Speed the video up and check out the result the article is now done and let's do a refresh right here and check it out so we have our featured image table of contents key takeaways and then under this second H2 right we have our affiliate link and we can click on it and see that my tag is added on the end of it so again you can come in here into Penny Arcade and you enable custom outline and you can put CTA wherever you want you could put it under each one of these if you really wanted to you go totally crazy and this is a very basic custom outline there's much more complex ones that you can mess around with I'll pause pause the video for a second check this out digest it and then definitely go to this directional guide up here to learn more about how to use this so that's the first place where you can use a custom outline let me copy the URL from Amazon again and show you the next place so we open up the SEO writer and we can put like a title for our article in here best level for Woodworkers we'll say just two just for sake of demonstration I'm going to enable color outline and enable submitting background all you have to do for for ninety percent of you that just want to do Amazon stuff all you have to do is put in the URL for the product in this URL for scraping this is a new box before we had to put the URL in here but we have a new box for it and there's reasons for this that I won't go into but we put this URL for Amazon in this box right here let me put the title in like capro 985 now I want to give it a little bit of context so I'll say level to get your call to action link now that you've put the URL in and you've put the title in all you have to do to get that call to action link is Click trigger product layout when you press this button a couple things happen Zoom writer is going to write two paragraphs about this section it's going to give you some pros some cons in a bullet list and then also it's going to give you that call to action link using this URL right here and then if you have that Amazon affiliate code added it will append this on so you fill everything out you come down here and you simply Press Start SEO writer with scraping now there's another way that you can add a call to action inside of the SEO writer we can uncheck this box and we can put in c t a all right and zenwriter will do the same thing it will take whatever's in this box and create a call to action out of it now why would you want to do this I guess for one reason maybe you don't want that product layout maybe you don't want to trigger the product layout but there's another hidden use case for this let's imagine best places to visit in Japan imagine yourself as a travel agency so let's say we want to visit Tokyo and let's delete this and we want to visit Kyoto now let's pretend that and I'm a travel agent I want people to book with me so here's my booking URL https my travel agency.com book your trip to Japan you can say book your trip to Japan or just book your whatever you want whatever landing page you have it doesn't matter we'll take this we'll also put it right in here now what we're going to do is we'll come up here and we're going to add c t a we'll take that and we'll add it right here and then we'll start the article by pressing start SEO writer no scraping because remember we don't want this page scraped we simply want a call to action at the end of each section so that the the reader can book their trip with us so watch I'll do it right now we'll click Start SEO writer no scraping we'll let it run and we'll check out the results and I'll show you what I mean our article is now done we'll close this window and I'll refresh the page and we'll preview the output so we didn't get a featured image because I didn't select the I guess I forgot to select the enable image API but that's okay so there's our intro there's our key takeaways now look Tokyo now I didn't change the the call to action button I probably should have done that you can go into the options menu over here and we can say instead of view latest price I want it to be like uh book your trip and we'd save the options uh for that and that way this would say book your trip but if you look at it and I can't click on it because it's not going to go anywhere but if you look at the lower left hand corner down here it says mytravelagency.com book your trip so this is a way to create a call to action in the SEO writer for kind of whatever URL you want you know maybe you're reviewing a page that you don't want scrape that you just want a URL to a particular link you can do that now inside of the SEO writer a lot of cool ways that you can add your either Amazon affiliate code and then use that call to action link or even think outside the box and use the call to action link to other types of landing pages that you have that you want to you know make some make some good money on so that's all I got if you like the video please give it a thumbs up please like it drop
