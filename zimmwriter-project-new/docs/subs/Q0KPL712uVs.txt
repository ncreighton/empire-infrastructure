# Lesson 13 - How to Use SERP Scraping

in this lesson I'm going to share with
you how easy it is to use Ser scraping
inside of Zim writer to bring in much
more accurate facts about the article
that you're writing about and then also
SEO keywords and build a better outline
it's very easy to do inside of Zim
writer the first thing I want you to do
is to click on the secret training
button which will bring up this page and
then as you scroll down you'll find a
Ser scraping link so click that bring up
the page and definitely go through this
and read this at your leisure it's very
important there's a lot of very
important knowledge and Nuggets in here
to really get the most out of this
feature now this feature does surp
scraping does require scrape out but
once you set it all up it's very
powerful it's available in the bulk
writer in the SEO writer right now so
we'll click the bulk writer and all you
have to do you'll put your title in like
how to rank higher on Google you'll
click on the Sur scraping button and you
click enable and that's literally all
you have to do to use Ser scraping
inside of Zim writer but what exactly
happens behind the scenes when you go
and you write your article with Ser
scraping enabled so this is high level
right now this is what happens Zim
writer will perform the following steps
when you're Ser scraping so Zoom writer
first Contact scrap Al and ask scrap Al
to perform a Google search of the
article title and scrap Al will go out
to Google so how to rank higher on
Google and it will scrape the top
results so how to rank higher on Google
how to rank higher on Google it scrapes
all this data and brings it in then what
happens is it will store the results in
the cached database up to 1,00 SHP
scrapes and then Zer writer will
determine which web pages rank for that
term and are relevant to that term so as
an example how to rank higher on Google
yeah the first 10 results are all going
to relate they're all relevant to how to
rank higher on Google but if you have a
much more Niche subject like how to
train a snail I spell it wrong SN a i l
to write a unicycle you're not going to
get any results how to write a unicycle
learn how to write a un cycle watch till
the end to see me breaking my speed
record how to ride amount on a unicycle
so none of these results deal with how
to teach a snail to write a unicycle so
in that case your Ser scrape will likely
fail so serp scraping is very useful for
situations where you have a broader
query not something super Niche that no
one has probably talked about so Zim
writer determines the first five that
are relevant for the term and then once
it finds those pages it will scrape
those pages and then it will summarize
those pages and then uses the
subheadings from those five pages to
create your outline and then it uses the
summaries from those five pages to build
discussion points for each of the
subheadings in the article and then
finally it uses SEO keywords determine
from those articles to insert into your
particular article so a lot of stuff
happens behind the scenes that at least
in the bulk writer you don't need to do
much about it just automatically happens
now in the SEO writer you can see a lot
more of this uh up front so we'll put
our title in how to rank higher on
Google we'd click Ser scraping we'd
enable it and scrape the Ser now so
scraping the Ser now in the SEO writer
will allow you to pre-s scrape it and
edit the information and make sure you
have the best information possible
before you write the article you don't
have to do that we can just enable it
and then go down here and start writing
with or without scraping it doesn't
matter it will scrape this SHP because
we've enabled it up here you can do that
too it's totally up to you but we're
going to pre-sc scrape it now I've
already scraped this I've already had
Zoom writer go out and scrape this
particular query so it's going to pull
it from the cache database it's going to
be instantaneous watch this see it's
already done so there's the global
background based on the Ser
scrape and then here are the H2S and h3s
from the
competition so we can use option three
to create our H2S using the AI plus the
competition H2S and h3s plus the global
background to get a really comprehensive
outline so let's say we want 10 H2S for
instance and we'll press option three
and just wait a moment and there you go
so this is all based on the global
background the competition and then also
the AI now what's really cool is if we
let's enable color outline so we can
differentiate these enable subheading
background if you were to go and just
write the article right now come down
here and just say start the Su writer
with scraping or without scraping
because we've already scraped everything
it would go ahead and write the article
and then for each one of these H2S it
would pull in some discussion points
from this the graped Ser but you can
pull that stuff in beforehand and then
manually edit that if you really want to
this little SS button if we press it it
will create those discussion points
right now for us so understanding
Google's ranking metric prioritizes
relevant and useful pages for search
queries domains achieve ranking through
Google's algorithm process which
considers quality relevance and utility
so here's our different discussion
points now we can take some of these out
we can add to it it's up to you what you
want to do then when you're all done
with that you can configure the rest of
your options and you can go through
these SEO keywords and edit them if you
really want to but it's going to try to
use these so keywords as it writes the
article then finally you just either
start the writer with scraping or no
scraping it doesn't really matter and it
will write your article it's very easy
with Ser scraping now inside of Zim
writer to bring in factually correct
data from the Google ser and then bring
in those keywords and build a really
high quality outline with just a couple
