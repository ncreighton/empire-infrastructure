# Lesson 20 - How to 1-Click Nuke AI Words

in a nutshell the AI delves into the
realm of language with a deep dive
ensuring a transition into the crucial
yet daunting task of selecting words as
if it were a kid in a candy store unable
to resist its
favorites I hate AI words do you hate AI
words too now there's a way inside of
Zim writer to Nuke those AI words let me
show you how it works so inside of Zim
writer there's an options menu click the
button and you'll see this option down
here called set AI words to Nuke you
open it up and there's a default list in
here right now now some of these you
might not want you might not think
they're important so you can just delete
them or maybe you have your own list of
words just keep in mind the words need
to be comma separated so you'll put them
in here and you'll put a comma next to
each one and then once you have your
list completed you'll click save
changes and also read the directions up
here there's more in the directions that
I don't cover in this video uh some
nuances on how this whole thing works
and then when you go into the bulk
writer or the SEO writer or Penny Arcade
or the product runup feature if you go
into any of these tools there's a little
check box called nuke AI words all you
have to do is click that button and then
Zoom writer will do an additional prompt
after it's generated the particular
section and this works on introduction
conclusion subheadings and then also
FAQs after it's written that particular
section but before it does a skinny
paragraph before it does a translation
before it does your your custom prompts
okay it will try to nuke those AI words
now just be aware all right I want to
leave you with one thing sometimes it
will replace a word with another AI word
so you know we can get like a 90%
reduction or maybe a 95% reduction but
you still might see one of those AI
words still hanging around but it's
going to be significantly better if
nuking AI words is your number one
priority in life so any questions about
that uh just drop a comment down below
