# Lesson 1 - How to Use the 1-Click and Bulk Writer

hey welcome to your getting started guide with Zim writers oneclick in bulk writer this is going to be a short video very high level I'm not going to go through all the options if you want much more of a deeper dive there's an advanced video on both of these features but for right now we're just going to give you that high level overview so you can get started and generate either one article or even up to a thousand articles at the end of the video we're not going to talk about WordPress integration or AI images that's all for the more advanced video let me bring up the Zim riter menu and I have an uh list of blog post titles in here so you'll find the one-click writer right here and we can click the button and it will bring up this very sparse menu there's not a lot of options I wanted the oneclick to be super easy to use you can't configure anything aside from the title of your blog post so we can put our title in five steps to get good grades in college now realize the bulk writer and the oneclick writer are suited for informational type of Articles you don't want to use product roundups or product posts like like um top five graphics cards for 2024 or review of the iPhone 14 or something like that those aren't well suited for just the bulk writer or the one-click writer with a little caveat you could be using Ser scraping with the bulk writer but that's for the advanced video that's not for this so in general you're not looking at product type Roundup posts you're looking at more informational type of posts for this so this is an example of a listicle a list of steps or list of items five steps to get good grades in college you can put that in between 3 and 15 or you can do a normal informational article how to get good grades in college either of these will work and all you have to do is press okay and you'll see a little progress bar down here and when it's done it will spit out an article in the Zim writer directory in the output folder so we can open this up and this is the article I had it write before the video now again we used the oneclick for this so we couldn't configure any options it was just set it and done but this entire article cost us one penny so one penny for the whole article 1429 words and you'll notice this is like weird this is not like a Word document or something like that this is a text file with some weird hash marks in here if you don't know what this is this is called markdown there's a link up here to convert this markdown to a format that you're more accustomed to so let me click this link you don't have to do this you can if you use WordPress for instance and use Gutenberg you can just copy this stuff right here and paste it right into Gutenberg and it will automatically convert it but maybe you want to take all this stuff and put it into phrase or Surfer or some kind of thirdparty editor and edit it that way if you do then you want to do what I'm going to show you right now so I opened this link and here's this converter and I'll open our directory here I'll just take this text file and I'll drag it over here and drop it and I'll download download the file and then what we get is a nice word document with everything formatted nice and neat so now I can take this and I can put it into whatever text editor I want and edit this file now you don't have to do that we have all kinds of other options to upload this to WordPress but that's for the more advanced video now that is the oneclick writer very simple to use now if you want to customize your output a little more that's when you want to use the bulk writer let me open it up now don't be confused by the word bulk writer you can write just one article if you want to or you can queue up to a thousand different articles it's
