some some general overviews and then I'll take questions and answers at the end uh should be a lot of fun hopefully you'll learn a lot I was uh I did a zoom call with a lady yesterday and it was uh it was actually more informative for me than for her because we were going through the SEO writer and she's like oh I never knew about that stuff so I've been living in the development cycle for months now and so I'm like oh yeah these these features we had them months ago but some of you have not so this might be um a really eye-opening experience for a lot of you I might be able to share a lot of the cool new features that we have inside of the SEO blog writer and how you can apply them to writing SEO optimized content so let me switch over to my desktop right here uh now make sure you have the latest version I pushed out 7.5 for you know whatever a couple days ago now there's auto update so once you manually update you'll now be able to just click this little button right here and it will uh look for an update on my server and then also every 24 hours we'll ping the server and look for an update too and this will turn green so a lot easier now too I feel like we're living in the 21st century with with these auto updates uh and then I recommend um we're gonna do a deep dive into to using the SEO writer I recommend clicking this button right here training and help and and really going through the different guides and training that's in here the uh the exhaustive guide this is this is really important I spent a lot of time on this exhaustive guide there's a lot of features that are shared between the different tools like if I click on the bulk writer for instance there is an enable list option okay there's an enable tables option and those options also exist in the SEO blog writer okay all of the the explanation for the shared features the shared options are going to be in this SEO blog writer guide okay they won't be repeated in these other guides so if you see an option that you don't know about first check this guide and and see if there's some some usage tips in there this is it's very when I say exhaustive it really is exhaustive it covers a lot of um stuff in here like for instance we just had the custom prompt that we added in the in all these different features the SEO the bulk and the penny arcade there's a custom prompt you can add okay so there's some guidance on that right here and um this will teach you you know some different tips some different tricks on how you can use the uh the custom prompts the let's see go back to the SEO there's also the YouTube videos you know so it explains how to use that in here so definitely check this guide out and and investigate how you can best use the SEO writer because I clearly can't cover everything in this this hour-long or this I guess 30 minute walk through and then 30 minute q a so so let's let's dive in and get started with kind of developing an article to write about I I was thinking we got to write about something you know we need something to write about I said well let's let's think about something like a cool Niche that maybe isn't explored yet and I came across this concept of AI inside of law firms um so there's not a lot of uh uh difficulty with these you know we've got about 45 difficulty so I think it's something that we could potentially rank for because if you think about it you know we had those those stereotypical people that the guy that wanted to use AI in his law firm and he used it to draft that con that case uh that responds to the court petition or whatnot and then it's cited these fake cases so clearly there's a desire to use AI in law but you have to be able to use it correctly and a lot of these lawyers don't know how to do it you know they're on the technical side but this would probably be a great great Niche to dive into because there's a lot of money you know you want to talk about some great ways to make money as an affiliate marketer or as a just a a website owner Ai and law is is a really interesting Prospect in my opinion I did some uh some more searching on it and I got this this keyword right here now it doesn't look like there's any search volume but you have to realize this is new this is all Cutting Edge stuff and when we actually go to Google and we perform this search it's uh there's there's quite a lot of stuff on it so it seems to be a hot like this is the American Bar Association seven ways artificial intelligence can benefit your Law Firm what is AI and how can a lot of firms use it so it seems like there's a lot of interest in this but maybe not a lot of build out so I don't spend too long on this whole Niche thing you know I just want to give you an overview of kind of why I chose to write an article on this so what I would do first once we have our keyword keyword is going to be how AI can help law firms is I'd go over here to the SEO writer and you have to realize the keyword that we're putting in here so let's start with the basics the keyword that we put in isn't necessarily going to be your H1 it's not necessarily going to be your title tag okay this is going to be the the term that the AI is going to use or the phrase the keyword long tail that the AI is going to use as it writes the article okay as it generates if you're using one of these options as to generate your your um your H2S your h3s h4s it's going to use that okay as it actually writes the the subject matter for these different hqs and whatnot it's going to use this so you don't want something complex like Ultimate Guide and tips and tricks because that's not really helpful to the AI now that would be very click friendly you know when you're all done with your article but from a writing for using the AI standpoint you want something very simple so we'll start with this this can be our very simple title now you probably already know this but we can just click this button right here generate H2S using only the AI and it will go ahead and do that but we're going to actually put some background in and generate the headings using some background information and also the competition H2S and h3s so we have a couple different titles or H2S up here now what's really important not a lot of people know this is the model that you choose DaVinci gpt4 GPT 3.5 affects the actual H2 titles when you use one of these generation methods so you can actually choose for instance like DaVinci and then generate the titles using DaVinci and then switch back after you you know you have all your AI titles done you can switch back to Turbo to actually write the entire article and save a few bucks so you don't have to use the same model that you use to generate the headings as you do to generate the article now someone asked me what's the difference between these three first and foremost the the quality of them is is constantly changing well I don't know if Da Vinci is Da Vinci seems to be pretty stable but open AI has been modifying gpt4 and GPT 3.5 turbo if I were to rank them I would say GPT 3.5 turbo is the least expensive but it's also not the smartest then Da Vinci's kind of the middle of the road it's smart and it's um it's fairly inexpensive okay and then gpt4 is more expensive but it's also the smartest of all the different models what I do like about DaVinci is again it doesn't seem like they're modifying the the underlying model at all they're not updating it and whatnot so I think your quality that you get from it will be consistent if you can reach a point that you really like with DaVinci um it probably shouldn't change whereas I know they just pushed an update for Turbo out a couple weeks ago and that really changed a lot of the quality that we were seeing and I had to modify the prompts and whatnot but uh I'll typically if I'm going to use AI I'll use one of these two models to to generate my my headings and then I'll either stick with those to generate the article or I'll use turbo all right um so let's let's get some some data to put in This Global background and whatnot what I typically do if I'm going to use this Global background section is I want to find a meaty article I want to find an article with a lot of keywords a lot of text a lot of content that I'm going to use in here and let me take a step back I guess why would I even want to use a global background okay you can use the SEO writer without the global background and you can use the SEO writer without scraping URLs and stuff like that some people might just want to use the the SEO writer to have customized titles for your different H2S and h3s and that's perfectly fine all right but if you don't care about the titles you have if all you do is you come in here and you click option two to generate your titles I don't even know why you're using the SEO writer okay just use the bulk writer the SEO writer is meant for when you really want to come in and customize things you want or you want to teach the AI things it doesn't know okay so that's where we use the global background to teach the AI things it doesn't know that's where we would use subheading background if the AI wouldn't know about this thing we'd put some you know a URL or some background information in here so how AI can help law firms I think the AI could probably write a pretty decent article on this but I'd rather seed it with some knowledge so there's a couple ways you can do this you don't need phrase to accomplish what I'm going to show you all right what I would typically do is I would I would take the search query and put it into here and then you know do your search and then look at the top 10 or top 20 results and then find something that has a lot of meat to it you can do the same thing in phrase um how AI can help law firms and then go to the outline mode and select headings from search results and I'll show you the word count for each of these different sites and then also their their outline structure so you can say okay you know this does not look uh very useful from a um a little background standpoint but this does it looks like there's a lot of important things in here that are relevant to how AI can help law firms so I could visit that site and we'll look at some of the other different headings but you don't need phrase to do this you can just do this manually in Google but I think this kind of speeds up the process AI for lawyers okay so we'll take this too so we can look at the different headings what is artificial intelligence okay AI in the legal industry so we have e-discovery legal research document management litigation and you know you might not be a lawyer you're probably not a lawyer so this stuff might not be very um you might not have a lot of knowledge on this so sometimes when I'm using this section in here and making sure that I'm I'm covering all my bases what I will do is I'll ask the AI kind of what what some of this stuff's all about so I did this prompt before I started the video write a list or what is a list of 10 things that attorneys do each day and this kind of seeds my own brain seeds my own knowledge about what an attorney might do so review legal documents legal research client meetings Court appearances so this is actually something I could just take and put into the global background section in conjunction with you know one of these these URLs that I like so this looks pretty good let's take this one so I'll take this website now the global background you can put up to three URLs into it I mean you can put more but it's only going to consider the first three and then what's basically going to happen is right now we're just using the fourth 4K models the 4000 token models which is 3.5 turbo Da Vinci and GPT or although that's eight um right now we can only put a mat the global background can only be a Max of like 1200 words or so okay so what it's going to do when we put a URL in here is it's going to summarize this and it will go URL you know it will go in order so we can put another URL in here and what's going to happen is it will summarize this first one and if it's short of a thousand or twelve hundred words it will then sort of summarize the next one it will keep going down the list for the list of three URLs and then once it's reached that thousand words it will stop scraping it will just truncate the results right there so just for this example though we'll just do one now we can click this button here to generate our H2S from the AI plus the competition H2 H3 and Oracle background so remember this option right here it generated the H2 is using only the AI we'll click option three it's actually going to scrape this URL for us and generate it using that URL but then also any data that we put into the the competition here so let's get some competition H2S and h3s now a lot of people I've seen they make this mistake they'll put in a couple keywords in here they'll say Okay I want to put in uh client meetings Court appearances you know Etc the problem with that is the way this works it looks for similarities so if we had instances where there were three instances of client meetings that would be very relevant very important so the AI would probably um focus on that one but if we just had like Court appearances one time then the AI might not choose that so it's really important when we're inputting H2 and H3 titles to actually get the whole list of H2 and H3 titles from the competition now this is a situation where you do need a serp scraper we don't have that yet inside of zimrider but if you have phrase I'll show you how to do it in phrase I'll show you how to do a neuron writer you can go to export we can export the serp data and then what you'll get is a PDF file okay and you click on this little headers tab down here and you'll see all the different headers from all the different top 20 serp results okay and you're going to want to go through this stuff all right so there's some examples in here like Jasper all right I don't want that in here there's more I don't want that in here um comments 227 I don't want that in here all right uh subscribe I don't want that in here so we want to filter this list out look at just the H2S look at just the h3s and we'll get this list of of cleaned up headers a little bit okay so I'll take this cleaned up list and I'll copy it and I'll go to the SEO writer and I'll paste that right in there okay and it doesn't matter that there's spaces that's not a problem at all okay so we have our our URL in here and we have our different H2S and h3s now what we can do is we can we can generate just five H2S right now okay or we can determine you know oh we want 10. whatever you do doesn't matter because we can always go back and modify this and regenerate it without scraping because what's going to happen is when we scrape this it's actually going to convert the URL to that summary okay so let's go ahead and scrape that right now now you don't need scrape out to scrape a lot of websites you can use your own IP address I'm in the US I'm in Ohio a lot of places aren't going to probably block my IP if you're overseas or something you might get blocked and that's a situation where scrape out can help scrape out is also very useful for these big sites like Amazon that are going to block your personal IP you don't want to get blocked from Amazon if you're married your spouse will probably be upset if you get blocked from Amazon you don't want that so it does Amazon you can scrape YouTube transcripts all that good stuff so and I'm looking at building syrup scraping too foreign let's see while that's working the other thing you can do is you can copy the H2S and h3s from the clipboard so you can actually build your um build your outline let's go back to the help page you can build your outline just offline or in chat GPT or something like that exhaustive guide so we have our outline was generated right here copy from the clipboard so if you want to copy your H2S and your h3s and your h4s from the clipboard and paste them in and not even use AI or you know maybe you're developing your outline you know inside of notepad or something you can do that okay we can go over here we can just copy this list and click option one it will automatically copy this in uh if you want h3s all right then you need to you need two dat or you need one dash and if you want H4 is you need two dashes so so watch this I can actually take this whole thing and we're going to go back over here and actually that might cause a problem because I don't have to delete it all let's just take this and we'll copy it from the clipboard and see we instantly pasted this right into here again if you want h3s and h4s this is the formatting you need to follow okay let's go back and and generate this again because I just over wrote it all now it's not gonna have to scrape anything because it's already scraped then I just change the da Vinci or something so here's the summary from the URL that we scraped okay now I always recommend going into the summary especially if you're using um summaries down here and and looking at them because the the summary the scrape is never completely perfect there's a lot of content in the footer it might catch that and bring that into the summary too so you you want to avoid that okay so you want to kind of go through this and see if there's stuff that you need to edit out now this is just the data from that URL but what we actually want let's change this back to 10 what we actually want is that AI list to also help so we'll take this list and I'll go back to that Global background so this is the summary we had from the URL and this is the stuff from the AI and we'll generate it again so look at the headings I'm going to change down here there we go so we have we have ai overview machine learning NLP for drafting okay integration considerations competitive advantages learning effectively tools for productivity document review contract that's pretty cool now I don't know depending on how important you know on a website you'll have different types of Articles you'll have very very important articles and these are articles that either are worth a lot to you all right a lot of money to you for whatever reason you know maybe somebody paid you to make that article so they're very important to you or maybe it's a very very uh high traffic keyword that you're targeting so that could be a very important article to you in that situation I would use this SEO writer I would take my time I would go through this I would make sure the headings are exactly what I want okay there's less important articles right articles that you're either they're supporting articles or they're low competition articles in those situations I'd use the bulk writer or I'd use the penny arcade you know what whatever you decide to do ultimately you are building silos on your site you're going to have your pillow article this could be our pillow article for instance um how AI can help law firms and then you'd have supporting articles in linking to it like review it you know AI in a lot in reviewing legal documents or how AI can help in client meetings and stuff like that okay so there's some situations where you'd go slower there's some situations where you'd go faster the slower ones I'd go through this the more important ones I go through the SEO blog writer so we have our headings here now let's say we want some subheadings all right so let's say for um for legal let's modify this NLP for legal drafting so let's say we want three subheadings three h3s okay so here are h3s in the past you'd have to manually fill these out but now there's a little S button and this is this is awesome I absolutely love this because there's other AI tools that will generate your entire outline in one go but the problem is it's not easy to go back in and then modify the the H3 list modify that H4 list it's kind of a manual process with zimwriter everything can be automated so we'll click this S button and zenwriter we'll use that Global background and it will potentially use if you had a background in this section it would use that too to then generate these different h3s so NLP for legal drafting NLP benefits automation advantages AI considerations okay now if you don't like those you can you can change it to to whatever you want you want more you want less he said I just want one H3 now or I don't want any h3s you know that's fine too tools for productivity so this can be your product Roundup if you want to so we can say okay we want you know four h3s here and then we're gonna go over here and switch to gpt4 and it will click this little S button it'll Auto generate our h3s for tools for productivity so see how easy it is you can do the same thing with h4s let's go to let's make two h4s right here we'll click the S button so we now have some some h4s again you don't have to click the S and have the AI generated all you can do it manually too if you want to but that option is available for you there okay let me clean this stuff up now the enable subheading background let's kind of move down this list of different things I don't want to take up too much time a couple different options here okay you can whenever zimrider writes a section so writes this section on machine learning it's going to use this background information up here whatever is in here but it's also going to use whatever you've put inside here okay so you can find let's see you can go to Google and you can type in like AI for let's wait let's do a different one let's do integration consideration AI into your Law Firm so what you could do is you can find something that speaks right on it here you go integrating AI into your Law Firm now I don't know what this site is I haven't done any research on it but we can take this URL if we can go over here and we can paste it right into there okay and now if you wanted to you know you could do this for all your different sections and then scrape them all at once or individually you can just come down here and say I just want to scrape uh URLs only so it's going to scrape that one URL give us that one background section then we can go in and modify it and adjust it accordingly or you can put in all you know you can completely fill out your whole thing and then scrape it all at once and then go back and edit it and modify it let's look at the comments while that's working right now all right all right so so again the AI probably doesn't know about integration considerations with law firms um there's limited knowledge or maybe it's a niche subject it's also Cutting Edge too it's a Cutting Edge technology so we want to see what other people have written we scrape the URL and here's a summary that it generated adoption of AI and technology and legal industry for increased efficiency and cost savings potential benefits so we did a scrape and if we don't like this we can come here and we can delete it or we can put in our own information one thing I've seen people try to do that does not it's not intended is they'll put in directions okay they'll put in you know use the keywords you know a b c um use first person pronouns you know this is not a section for directions okay this is for knowledge that the AI does not already know and again when it writes this section it's going to write using this Global background and then also this the stuff that you put in here now be aware that if you're using one of these more expensive models gpt4 or Da Vinci or whatnot this is open AI charges you based on the data that's sent to open Ai and the data that you get back from openai so we're sending this Global background plus this this content here for each of these requests okay so it can add up because this is more computational power that the AI needs when it writes so just be aware that the prices can go up if you're using these more exclusive models that's why a lot of times if it's not a money article for me I'll just use turbo and be happy with it now you see this other option called trigger product layout okay now this is a really interesting option this is for if you're writing a review of a product like almost like a product Roundup let's see here product layout enable product layout oh trigger product layout there we go so what this does is when you click this button and it's the AI will try to do try to use it even if it's an improper use okay but let's say you had uh the name of a product in here you know law you know law 360. case briefer I don't know you know maybe you had a couple different tools you're reviewing um when you trigger the product layout okay and the AI is not going to know about this okay so you'd want to use background information because the game is going to have no idea about this particular product okay so and you could do this for Amazon products or specific products that you get from the internet doesn't matter but when you trigger the product layout what it's going to do is the AI is going to write two paragraphs um reviewing the product based on this background information here and then also write a list of pros and cons now if you don't want that what you can do is you can come down here and there is the tail end of the trigger layout prompt so write three so we're gonna the product layout prompt whenever you click that button it's going to do that for that subsection so we're gonna we click that button and then the output for this particular H2 subsection is going to be two paragraphs and then a list of pros and cons regardless of what you do down here it's going to write those two paragraphs but then what comes after those two paragraphs you can modify down here so instead of writing three bullet point lists of product specs oh and product specs pros and cons you can say you know write all right a list of product specs okay and that and that's it and when you do that it's going to modify how that output is is going to appear okay let's see so as we now if you don't if you don't like this you don't want trigger product layout you just disable it and then also I believe if you uncheck this thing your background information might go away so just be careful once you've triggered it and you got your background in there yeah it erases it from the memory so if you're going to use backup information hey don't uncheck this button or it will vanish okay now maybe you've spent a lot of time working on your outline okay let's where'd our outline go so let's take this right here and we're totally changing up what we're writing about right now but we're going to copy this outline into here so maybe you've spent a lot of time so remember if I'm going too fast what I did was I took this outline this format right here our H2S this Dash to make an H3 this Dash to make an H4 I copied it all in here so maybe we've created this manually we spent a lot of time creating this manually and we want to save it we want to we don't want to lose this what you can do is click copy click to copy outline to clipboard and then we can go over here and we can paste it and save it kind of for later you know so you don't lose it or maybe you want to edit it some more so we can come in here we can say you know what um I want to edit you know a bunch of different things I want to take some stuff out and then when you paste it back in it will adjust it accordingly okay uh now a lot of these options you should be familiar with um the the section limit usually length I usually check short I find personally uh it's a happy medium it's a a good readable size if the AI doesn't know about the topic and you are using Global background what can happen is if you choose medium or long and you have a lot of different headings a lot of different subheadings you could get repetition between them uh if you want to avoid repetition what I'll typically recommend is using that Global or that that subsection background for each one of these to avoid that repetition when you're going longer because then you're giving the AI more to write about as opposed to just this very heavily weighted Global background okay uh The Voice you should be familiar with this already you know you your uh yours I mean my we us our and then professional which tries to avoid personal pronouns the none um I don't really know what that does I just don't prompt the AI so I think your results will just kind of vary depending on the type of article you're writing if you're writing an article about how to care for a baby and you click none it's probably not going to come out in a professional tone of voice it's probably going to come out in this um second person you your and yours uh tone of voice literary devices you should already be aware of that a lot of this stuff again is explained in here we have lists tables uh we have our long FAQs and short FAQs there's an option for a mid-journey prompt for each H2 by default uh Zim writer will generate this mid Journey prompt for your the top of the document but if you want a mid Journey prompt underneath each of the H2S not h3s and h4s just the H2S you would just check this box and that would give you that prompt right there the key takeaway section you're going to get that key takeaways of the entire article and how this actually works it actually takes a little bit of time because what's going to happen is zoom writer is going to go and summarize the entire article after you've written it so it will write the entire article and then it will basically kind of do what the penny arcade does or that summarize equal does inside of uh you know if you're familiar with it there's a summarized equal and you can put in either a URL or a bunch of text and it will summarize it that's exactly what's going to happen here it's going to Chunk Up the article if it's over you know a certain length and then Summarize each point and then summarize all of that stuff and then write key points based on that it only uses turbo so don't be scared of prices I think for a 10 000 word article it would probably cost you two pennies because it's going to use turbo for that even if you decide to choose gpt4 or whatnot uh what else so custom prompt is very interesting I almost need like a whole other training section on this this allows you to um how do I explain this what this is going to do is for whatever sections you select so let's say introduction and let's say uh normal subheadings before the the introduction it's going to take the title of the article and then the content of the introduction and send that to open Ai and then apply whatever you have in here to it so if you say write it using the aidi copy thank you technique okay and you apply it just to the introduction okay then that's what's going to happen it's going to rewrite the introduction all right using the Aida copywriting technique now where this happens okay in in the in the grand scheme of things I don't write Zim writer when you look at the top of a generator document it will say you know we made 77 calls to open AI so I don't just ask the aie write an article here's all my prompt here's my one prompt and it spits out this 3000 word article it's not what it what we do at all we chunk everything up into into different passes in different sections so one particular H2 section when it's writing about our H3 section identifying Target keywords it might make three different calls to open AI the first call to write the section using the prompt data and then the second section to apply skinny paragraphs and then the third or the third pass to apply a translation if you choose that so where this custom prompt comes into play is after Zim writer after the AI generates this particular section it will then feed this custom prompt you know we're talking about the introduction here so after generous introduction it will feed this custom prompt in and then kind of rewrite that introduction according to whatever you have in here and then it will apply skinny paragraphs and then it will apply the translation so that's kind of it's inserting it where you where you kind of wanted this to to apply now just be careful though we want to write using the aid Aida cochrome technique if you apply to all this stuff your article is going to turn out to be garbage okay we don't want uh you know the uh identifying Target keywords to apply the Aida copywriting technique okay so this is a powerful prompt but it applies wherever you check it and then I'll also see a lot of people they'll take their chat GPT prompts and feed it in here they don't they don't get good results so this is definitely a trial and error um situation I would recommend you know if you're like I really don't like how the the normal subheading stuff is generated I don't like that stuff I want to modify it I want you know less transition words or something like that okay then I'd probably generate three H2S all right three of them and then use turbo and then feed in your prompt and do some tests all right and modify your prompt and do some more tests you know try try to try it and see what you get okay so that the we talked about the introduction when we did the introduction it would feed in the title of the article and then also the um the introduction itself when you click on a normal subheading it would not feed in the title of the article it would feed in the subheading title and then the the subheading content okay now you can also select an independent model independent of whatever you're using to write the article to apply this custom prompt so you can write your entire article using turbo but then use gpt4 to modify the uh the pro you know if you're applying this to the introduction to modify the introduction okay this will enable or disable it if you enable it then the little box turned green down here to remind you that it's enabled and when you click this button this will basically put the prompt in the header of the text file so you can remember what prompt you used so if you're doing some tests and you want to see what the different tests are are producing you can log The Prompt in the file header and then say oh you know this out of the five tests I did this particular prompt I really like YouTube videos I I hope that you were aware of this now you need scrape out to use this um if you click this button and don't have scrape value you'll get a little error message what this will do is for headings number one H2S H2 number one H2 number three and H2 number five depending on how many videos you select you just select one it will just do it for the first H2 it will go to YouTube and try to find a relevant YouTube video that you can then embed into your article okay so if you have scrape out you check this box you go over here and say I want three YouTube videos and it doesn't always find three okay depending on how Niche your subject is maybe it can't find a relevant YouTube video but what will happen is if it finds one for the first H2 it will insert that depending on whatever you choose up here right now it's going to insert it as an HTML embed code but if you disable this it will insert it just as a raw uh YouTube link okay and then when you paste that into WordPress I believe on Gutenberg if you're using Gutenberg it will auto convert that to an embedded YouTube video really cool really weight a really cool way to boost your your relevance hopefully in Google's eyes and also the reader the reader will they see those videos they watch those videos that page in time page on time will just Skyrocket right there so uh really cool feature audience personality you can click this little button to learn more about it it's all detailed in this exhaustive SEO guide um let's see non-english language everything else pretty straightforward now let's talk keywords really quick okay let's talk our keywords but before we do that let's um let's regenerate our our headings because I kind of erased everything all right uh DaVinci I'm really happy this has not crashed on me I'm not expecting a crash but it's always in the back of my mind doing a live presentation all right so here's all our different H2S kind of about that law from how AI can help law firms back kind of where we started now let's talk keywords for a second okay this is and we'll end on this and then I'll take questions and whatnot for the remainder of the time I'll stay as long as you guys need me to this is a section that a lot of people get confused on again it's it's all detailed here in this exhaustive guide um manual keywords you can choose automatic keywords for this section and automatic keywords is an option for both the the um uh where the other menu go it's available in the bulk writer too and also the penny arcade now these are not like SEO scored keywords or not keywords from semrush or something like that these are keywords that the AI came up with but all right automatic keywords I have Founders are actually very valuable because they can take the the article in a different direction so think of the keywords the automatic keywords is not a um a a volumetric keyword you know analysis we're not putting keywords in based on volume instead we're giving the AI New Directions to talk about and to take the article now you can go to the options menu and you can click this right here um no wait where is it there we go you can uncheck this thing this is checked by default it says don't display the auto keywords used in files if you uncheck it what will happen is the output for the file will actually display if you check those Auto keywords it will display what those Auto keywords are and you can generate the same article five times and you'll get different keywords for each of the different subsections and I find it's really cool because it will take that that article in a different direction that you didn't possibly think about you'll get something unique something different than if somebody else were to generate an article on the same topic but if you don't want to use automatic keywords because you can only use automatic or manual you can't use them both you would use manual okay now we'll I'll show you how to do that with phrase and also with neuron writer so in phrase when you downloaded that remember we went to phrase and we click this export export serp data uh there's something called topics okay and these are all the different uh keywords that phrase NLP keywords phrases determine are relevant so these are the long tail keywords these are the long tail okay and this is how you get that high score inside of phrase or neuron writer okay and there's also top top topics what's your your short tail okay I don't really like when I when I get this list I filter out people said oh we want we want single word keywords I think that's silly because this stuff's naturally going to be talked about in your article as it writes on this subject but people Wanted single word keywords so I allowed them to then have that in this list but I always end up deleting these things because there's always context associated with this like we're writing an article about how AI can help law firms well the AI is naturally going to talk about lawyers so we don't need lawyers as a short tail keyword in this list okay clients technology but when we click on one of these um it should I guess that's not how you do it it will show you here we go how it's used so like tasks for instance when we open it up there's mail tasks routine tasks legal tasks I'd rather have those long tails than just the short tail tasks because what what's the AI going to do with that whereas the routine tasks the manual tests might give the AI something more to think about and then bring into the article so the tldr of that is I filter out the short tail keywords and just leave the long tail in the list so you can take up to 150 keywords and you can leave the blanks in there that's perfectly fine if you want to you paste it in here into this list now before we click uh start SEO writer without scraping because we've already scraped everything we need before we we start writing the article okay we have to figure out how many keywords we want in each subsection if you're trying to achieve a high score inside a phrase or neuron writer or whatever your your tool of choice is and you have for instance 150 keywords okay that phrase expects to see in here but you only have like three H2S all right there's no way it can fit 150 keywords into those three H2S it's just going to be keyword stuffing so if you have a lot of keywords you want to make sure number one that you have a good amount of H2S or h3s or h4s okay you want a decent amount and the next thing you want to pay attention to is this little indicator right here and this indicator applies for both the automatic and the manual what this is going to do is it's going to say okay how many keywords am I going to put into each subsection now what you need to realize is this list of keywords each keyword is I I'm going to say it's only going to be used once but that's not necessarily true I'm only going to prompt the AI to use like this keyword one time and then after I've prompted the AI to use it I delete it from the mix okay so don't think that if you just put this keyword in one time it's going to try to use it like 15 times or something like that it very well might all right but it but it would just be using it naturally not because I prompted it okay so what this is saying right here is how many keywords do I want to tell the AI to use per subsection well we have 130 keywords and we have 10 H2S so to get them all in I'd have to use more than 10. so I can't use more than 10 keywords so let's just say eight and that should have the AI use about 80 keywords uh from this mix as it writes this article right here okay now I think that's about it um again I'd spend more time on this if I wanted to if this was a really you know real money article but that that should cover just about everything I did mention neuron writer let me show you in there how to use that so I'm in neuron writer how AI can help law firms you just scroll down to your keyword list and there should be a copy all visible terms to the clipboard we'll copy the list of terms and I pasted a notepad first because it puts these separators in here extended list of terms so I just delete that but I would still you can tell there's a repetition in here too there's a i a i a i a i so I think with neuron writer you might want to go through this a little bit more and filter out the duplicates you could probably take this right now and put it into Excel and filter out the duplicates and then put that into the uh the list of of keywords all right that wraps this up let me take some comments and questions for the remainder of the time and we'll uh we'll just end it there okay uh let's see here so if you have a question go ahead and type it in chat right now all right Paul asked Matt does the bulk writer allow the use of one title tag and up to 10 H2S to produce 50 different pieces of content this is the bulk rate so the bulk so Paul the the bulk writer you put in your titles all right and each title is going to give you one article and you're going to designate the number of H2 tags some people have been asking for a dynamic uh thing over here I'm I'm pondering that I think that might be a good idea because sometimes you might put in like five tips to lose weight seven tricks to get in to college with bad grades so in a situation like that like what do you do here you know you could choose five for your different H2S but then this is going to get kind of screwed up so I'm thinking of making this Dynamic uh in the near future but each title you put in assuming up understanding your what you're what you're asking each title you put in will give you one article but that's the bulk okay David says hrefs has a free Chrome extension that'll will give you the H sections when you visit a page okay BB said a great tip Mike's in Ohio hey Youngstown that's pretty cool let's see here Mohan saw what we say your name right writers in is best for the outline task in general matter executes this what a lucky me yeah it represents another great tool that people will use it's kind of like neuron writer kind of like phrase it it shares a lot of the same features a little bit of AI a little bit of uh of the this list of different keywords in here um yeah yeah BB some people have definitely complained about the size of this stuff I've tried to make the font size bigger for for some of these the bulks smaller than the SEO the SEO is bigger um but the recoded version I'm developing will be hopefully resizable I'm really hoping uh so Bob Sacramento you know Bob I guess it depends on he wasn't impressed with the the legal part I mean look people have to write articles all right people write articles and um publish them and then they get rent all right that's not to say that they can't be helpful if you were to fill your entire site with bulk content for a a topic such as law or something like that yeah it it probably would be very spamish you know but the SEO writer allows you to take your time I mean I went very quick all right if I was going to do this right I might spend a couple hours filling all this stuff out making it uh very detailed because at the end of the day you're having the AI write based on your knowledge so you know if you're a lawyer you fill in your knowledge into the into the background section about this different stuff and you have the AI help you write that article and it gets you further along than doing it by hand I mean you could also just send this out to a writer you can have the the writer write it what's the difference um I don't I do not recommend having the AI make up stuff so VB says can you do a demo an article creation about something Niche like how to design custom magic items in DND okay yeah sure let's do that really quick um I'm going to erase all the settings and so I don't know if there's we're going to forget about keyword volume and all this stuff right now how to design custom uh magic items and DND okay so something really Niche we don't care about search volume or anything like that but we're just using the the SEO writer to write that very Niche article now what you could do for something like this is you could use the penny arcade if you wanted to but we'll we'll use the SEO writer let's first see if there's some some stuff that we can see the ai's brain with all right there we go there's an article there that looks pretty good now this isn't my Niche so I I don't know I played DND one time it was pretty cool but not my Niche so I couldn't tell you if this stuff is correct or not uh but you'd obviously you know you'd want to figure that out first of all so we take these two things we can put them into the background right now I'm going to select DaVinci for our model and it looked like I don't know why it's scrolling so fast there's five steps here six steps there all right so let's just say seven steps and then all we do is we uh yeah we'll scrape the two URLs so we'll scrape these two URLs right now and then try to generate our titles now if you don't like the titles okay what we can do is we can come in here and you know see what the competition has and try to come up with some better titles or we can go into phrase and well that's running let's create a new article document let's go look at the comments what people are asking so I'm still still on BB's comment right now Paul Jones says what do you recommend gpt4 a 3.5 turbo for the best output what I found is gpt4 while it has a bigger brain it it tries to talk fancy you know it uses these big words that aren't commonly found on the internet you know we don't I don't know it's like a it's almost like it was trained on these very um technical Journal articles or something like that so you know it depends on your Niche all right I would probably test the output and then also maybe test the right in the style of maybe you could put like right in the style of an 8th grader or eighth grade teacher or something like that that's an option down here you put like an eighth grade teacher or something like that and then see if you can get it to write um using common language okay if you can then I would choose gpt4 for the uh for the money sites for the money articles like you know you're doing Finance or something like that oh yeah use gpt4 all the way but you don't want it to come out sounding weird you know so look at the competition and see how the they are um the language that they're using the word choices they're using does it sound like you know using simple language that an 8th grader would understand or is using complex terminology you know so you gotta you gotta hone that in and nail that uh first of all that's the most important part and you're gonna solve that with this right in the style of box right here if you're not by default getting the output that you want so let's extract the syrup data right here okay let's close this now what I didn't do and I probably should have done is is whenever I'm doing this in phrase or you're doing this manually too you want to look at the results especially for these lower competition things and yeah that we got to do this first we have to remove the stuff that's not relevant so 250 custom magic ideas um I don't think we need that that wouldn't be relevant that would skew our results uh magic items tutorial let's get rid of this Reddit thing need hilariously overpowered custom magic items nope this is a Fiverr we don't want that we don't want this Homebrew magic item creator all right I get nervous when I'm doing this on camera so I probably probably going to miss something screw something up but uh but that's what you do you go through whether you're using it phrase or some other tooler you're doing it manually and then when you export it I believe it should just be the yeah yes the results that you selected okay now I'll go over here and I'll filter and I'll just look at the H2S and h3s because some people use the H2S they should be h3s um get rid of comments right here for instance embedded for the narrative all right I'd spend more time going through this but we'll take this and actually let's give her the number stuff I'll take that and I'll go over to our competition I'll put that in there and then I'll re-click this now it's already scraped it's already done that scrape up here it has that background in so now we're seating with some even more knowledge and again if you don't understand it's important to go and look at the entire top 20 or top 10 serps H2S and bring those in not just like five things okay you just bring this then you paste it in here you're not going to get great results okay uh Dave method I don't know what the Dave method is so if you don't like it you just click generate again I know nothing about this does this look good baby I don't know I have no idea and then what you can do is we don't have a lot of things in here so you could write the article right now you could just say you know start SEO writer without scraping because we've already scraped and it will write the article but if it doesn't know about this stuff that's where the background comes in so and you know you're the expert on the DND stuff so what you do is if this is the heading that you want all right and you think the AI probably would not know and you can find out what the AI Knows by simply doing a magic command and saying you know you know what do you know about concept and in the context of so you can run that as a magic command you know and I'll click control one and this is just one way to get a feel for what the AI knows I don't recommend doing it for each different H2 in most situations if you are writing about something Niche then I would just go over here and put in the URL or put in the background information manually but for for stuff that the AI does know about um you don't need to do any of this stuff what I what I probably would not do though is take this and put it in here because the AI already knows this stuff okay again the background is for Stuff the AI does not know okay so Bibi I hope that answers your question so again go through all this stuff fill all the the sections after the a I would not know about uh scrape it all if they are URLs and then start the SEO writer all right what do we got um David asked through the manual keywords be grouped no uh the prompt on the back end is basically here's a list of keywords I convert them to a comma separated list on the back end here's a list of keywords tell me which ones you know give me three or give me six that would be relevant to this particular subheading it's something like that you know so you don't need a group um and whatnot Abdul Auto post uh that's it feature request not talking about those here have there been any changes to the magic command Wayne um I don't know but we can ask that after chat if you want to uh Essie Crainer asks so with the generator should you also get phrases supplemented I guess we can talk high level right now because SEO writer is for it's for two types of people people that want to really control the the subheadings okay and maybe BB I don't know if maybe this stuff's not there's no search volume on it okay but you just want to control those subheadings that's important for the SEO writer okay but it's also for uh people that want to rank people that are trying to get that high score inside a phrase or whatnot so so at sequena uh krana uh it depends on what you're trying to do if you are trying to rank then what you need is you need a way to find those keywords okay so whether you sign up for a free trial at semrush or you do a permanent subscription or something like that you know a lot of people can complete their entire site um roadmap from a keyword perspective with just the free trial in semrush or a one month subscription you need a keyword tool to find those keywords phrase is not a keyword tool writer Zen does have some keyword stuff in it but I'd prefer like hrefs or semrush because it's going to really find those those what would appear to be low search volume keywords that very well might have search volume at that Cutting Edge stuff if you are in a more recent Niche you'll need to find your keywords and then you'll need to figure out what keywords to put on the page okay right now I don't have scraping inside of zimrider and I don't have some other bells and whistles which might be coming soon I'm winking I don't know what I am winking with but there might be some stuff coming soon for those with the scrape out account not at the end of this month though uh but right now if you are trying to rank you're going to need to know what keywords you need to put into your article and the only way you're going to find that is with something like phrase or with something like writers and wherever it is on here uh or or neuron writer or something like that Jeff asks I knew where the Zim writer I see that you use phrasing a list of all the recommended tools to help build a solid article I can I've been thinking about making like a link on my website to the recommended tools but the the general workflow is you need a keyword tool to find your keywords if you can do that in writer's end if you can do that in neuron writer if you do that in phrase hey that's great if you need that keyword tool to find your keywords to build your article your your site your your site Silo structure because you're going to have those you know in the context of this AI Law Firm you can have that AI Law Firm you know main pillar article here's your landing page AI Law Firm article let me let me go bigger you'll have your your landing page your AI Law Firm article and then you'll have some supporting things on it like um best best AI tools for law firms um how AI Loft AI tools can affect the case briefing and stuff like that so you'll have all your supporting stuff all that stuff needs to at least start in one of these keyword research tools and then we have uh a need to find the keywords to put into the article itself and so you're going to need a phrase or neuron writer or uh or Surfer or Market Muse or one of those keyword uh placement tools and then you'll need you know your AI writer if you want to use AI obviously so you know I recommend zimwriter um Creator asks in H2 background should I use prompt or give it the information okay I think we covered this already but just to be clear up here This Global background section and or the background sections here I highly recommend not giving it um I should use the prompt for a I I guess I could understand your question two ways it says in the H2 background should I use the prompt or AI or just give the information yeah I would not go over to like here and say you know what do you know about the concept and Rarity of how to design custom DND items and then have the AI answer that and then take that and put that in here don't do that okay because the AI already knows this stuff this is just going to end up costing you more money likewise you don't want to put in the prompt you know what do you know about you don't put that in either what you put in here is stuff the AI does not know about okay um because if the AI knows all about this stuff like the AI knows a lot about SEO and backlinks and stuff like that so if you're writing a an article for a non-competitive SEO concept that the AI knows a lot about I may maybe just use the bulk writer okay don't use the the SEO writer but the SEO writer gives you that Global background and gives you those those subheading backgrounds so you can give it information that it does not already know all right Wayne about zimmeriter quitting and whatnot we can talk about that uh for scraping off camera I'd be interested to hear more about the issue to see if there's an issue on my end uh Paul Jones asked with the bulk blog writer I prefer to type in the H2 tags I want to rank for instead of no matter selecting automatic yep I don't know if you're asking a question oh you're just saying you like to type them in okay so Paul likes to manually type them in yeah you know what I typically do will sometimes I'll use the eight the H2 or the the AI to come up with stuff and then I'll see what it is and then I'll edit it now sometimes let's pretend I'm writing a a product Roundup article and it's like you know let's just do this uh three and it was like how to buy a lawnmower and it's like best lawn mowers of let's just say best lawn mowers factors to consider when buying a lot more then what I might do is I might come in here and I say okay I want five factors and I want ten products now I'm going to fill these these H2S the h3s in manually using products from from Amazon okay the product name from Amazon and and whatnot but over here I'm just gonna have the AI come up with it types of molar size and power features and price so that's an option too you can kind of mix and match what you decide to do Paul asks can you put a table in the background uh well the background section is just raw text so if you paste a table in um I don't know where you're going to get the table from I wouldn't recommend pasting in a markdown table but if you go and like paste a table in from the Internet it's just going to copy the text and paste the text in so I guess you theoretically could but it's not going to be a table Mike asked when I put when I went for my clients I put the company name in the style of box like AK Waterworks as an expert works great um yeah you can put in you you can put in right of the style of like Jim Bob's Plumbing okay but the AI doesn't know who Jim Bob is you know it's not going to know these it knows who Bill Gates is it knows who Steve Jobs is but it doesn't know who I am it doesn't I'm sorry it doesn't know who you are um so it might be biasing its opinion on the you said he'll put an AK Water Works as an expert plumbing company it's just going to write in the style of an expert plumber so I think you'd probably get the same results if you put an expert plumber as opposed to AK Waterworks uh what not okay Abdul asks again uh have you considered Auto posting um not in this in this implement this code base maybe in the next code base the recoded version yeah I know you uh Mike wants better UI yeah I'm I'm more function over form right BB is in the shower listening I'm just nervous on camera sometimes when I'm demonstrating stuff but you're in the shower listen that's really to give a TV in your shower that'd be awesome uh how do you know if the AI does not know something Paul Jones you know I that's hard that's a hard question to answer because I I've been saying if you've just joined I've been saying you use the global background to put in stuff that the AI does not know okay so when do you know if the AI does not know something I think maybe the rule of thumb is if you could ask your friend uh if you could pick let's do this if you could pick somebody random off the street and say what is this all right and it you know write a three-page paper on this topic then the AI probably knows about it so if I go to somebody on the street some random person I say what is AK Waterworks Plumbing I'd be like I have no idea but if you say who is Bill Gates that can be like well Bill Gates is the guy that made Microsoft you know okay is he worth a lot of money yes he's worth a lot of money okay um so maybe that's a good rule of thumb for me it's just I just worked with AI for a long time I just kind of know it I think you'll know it too if you work with it more it's not like a special skill or something like that you just have to understand that the AI has been trained on certain corpuses of of content and a lot of it came from Wikipedia um so the more more well-known things will will have a general knowledge but if you said like what are the top lawnmowers for 2023 the AI is going to have no idea that's where you're gonna have to go out to Amazon find those yourself put those in and then put those links so that they can script those Amazon uh urls Creator asks for the custom prompt option how should I use that can you just tell me by writing the intro um so custom prompt I think I covered this at the beginning of the video but you'll put in a prompt and it's going to send to the AI your prompt plus the current title whether it's the title of the article or if you're applying this to a sub a subheading it will send the title of the sub the subheading um so it will send the content for that section whether it's the introduction or subheading or whatnot plus the the title of the subheading or the title the article itself and then apply the prompt to it I didn't say like you know rewrite the article according to this rule or something like that and so the rule would be like write it using the Aida copyrighting technique and you would enable it and that's literally all you have to do and then when you write the article it's going to apply the custom prompt to that that section that you chose which in this situation was just the introduction but again be careful if you're applying it everywhere it's going to do that everywhere and that's not this particular prompt is not something you want everywhere so this is one of those very Advanced features that you can totally hose up your article with if you're not careful and heaven forbid you go to like the the bulk writer and you schedule a thousand blog posts and you do your custom prompt and it screws up here in your entire set of a thousand articles and you wrote them all using gpt4 don't come crying to me okay have you Aaron I have Aaron um asked an interesting question I have not though sorry Essie crunch I don't know I don't remember what I said I'm sorry um all right click uh click's just giving me a compliment hey thanks click click k so uh Thief Muhammad asks how do we run zenwriter in mid-journey together in one go to produce these bulk articles mid-journey does not have mid journey is the best AI image generator in the world right now it just it just is um there's they don't have an API right now there are services that you can quote unquote bulk generate with mid-journey but if you spent a lot of money I prepaid for you know for fast and for uh like stealth mode or something so no one can see what I'm generating um it can get very expensive you know for a year subscription I'm not going to personally take the risk of my account getting banned by using some kind of automation the rumor mill is they've been working on their own API solution and you can guarantee that when that's completed I'm gonna try my best to implement that or incorporate that into zimwriter right now zimwriter does produce these text files so we would have to then like generate the images um as files also uh we would make it work don't worry but that would solve the bulk image problem but right now um there's no real way to do it unless you're going to get down and dirty with uh parsing the output files and then using some kind of one of these these non-official and kind of dangerous mid-journey automators on the market right top gfxs can we get the exact H2 or H3 number the same h all right top gfx that's a penny arcade question I think your question is answered in the penny arcade exhaustive guide uh for those that have just joined us click the training and help button please click that button and then uh go to the penny arcade and read that article uh someone asks is there plan to include Claude AI in the future not near I don't know what near means near future I don't know what that means for some people my wife says I'm leaving in the near future get ready 30 minutes later we leave the house so near is a very subjective term um I think after the Mac version I'm going to look into that um I think that's the way forward having different AI models to choose from um but in the current code base because I'm recoding it to work on both platforms using one code base uh on the current code base I don't think we're going to do that if David asks if you're scraping to get the global background doesn't the AI know it already or are using URLs about new or very Niche topics the second part of your comment slash question David um usually I'm going to have it scrape URLs that it would not know about like the penny arcade is a great example like you can go to CNN and I can take this this current event article right here if it loads all right take this and I can go to Penny Arcade and put it in and click Start pinning arcade actually let's do Turbo and this is you know all of the functions are kind of shared so this is exactly what's kind of happening it's going to scrape this um this URL but then it's going to write an article all right it's not going to just give you that summary it's going to write an article using that summary so the AI has no idea about this judge sets May 2024 trial date for Donald Trump in documents case so when you're using the SEO blog writer or any scraping functionality in zimrider you're probably going to use it for Stuff the AI does not know about and you know the um Amazon's a great example of that the AI does not know about these really Niche stuff like you want to get some some reviews on the best gummy vitamins for kids the AI is not going to have any idea about the specific products so that's when you would use that Amazon URL you need scrape out to do that to scrape those sites and pull in that very unique data that the AI was not trained on um don't worry about that Essie uh okay I think that any more questions I'll wait for this to generate and I'll show you I really love the penny arcade it's a lot of fun the penny arcade is great for if you're um let's see if I have paint here I was I need like a better sketching program so like if you're you're this is it kind of covers the SEO writer a little bit imagine this being your homepage up here you know you're gonna have your pillars your pillar articles so in the context of AI for law firms this could be like best AI or AI tools for law firms AI um I'm doing this really off the cuff so so give me some Grace on this you know AI um in in case briefs you know AI in trials so you know you have your different areas of of law let's see was that in here client meetings Okay so this could be like our different pillars you know AI for legal research AI for court appearances AI for for client meetings okay so we have our different pillars in there here's our landing page and then off of here we have our supporting articles so these pillars would probably be generated using your SEO writer okay but then within them you're going to have links to your supporting articles so this could be a supporting article if this is um AI for client meetings so this is our client meeting one all right this could be an article about um you know I don't know I can't come up with it off the cuff but you have some supporting articles over here now depending on what the AI knows you might use the the SEO writer to write these articles okay uh but if the AI does know about these then you might just use the bulk but you could also use the penny arcade for some of these so you know you don't want to spend a lot of time you don't want to spend three hours generating it but the AI doesn't know about it then what you can do is just put a competitor's URL in there all right and then generate the article obviously check for plagiarism and all that stuff but that's a great way to have the AI write about Niche stuff really quickly and really easily so go here's our our article we just wrote on this CNN thing so I'll open up so again the AI was stopped learning in 2021. so hopefully you can see this on my screen here judge orders trial date for Donald Trump in the classified documents case in the United States federal judge has recently established a trial date for Donald Trump the former president in a case involving the mishandling of classified documents the trial slated to uh commence May 2024 with a pre-trial hearing scheduled the same month um and you do get a little bit of repetition sometimes depending on how long the article was or how short it was but this is all stuff in here that the AI had no idea about see in the fraud case Trump is facing a trial date in October 23 so that's in here somewhere I'm sure we can I'm sure we can find that somewhere see in October 2023 so it's using stuff from the article so this is an example of why we would want to scrape uh something because the AI would not know about it okay let's see any other questions um Creator says for the an informational article I didn't get the answer in the H2S so for that can I add the same H1 in the H2 to get the answer I'm not sure I understand I'm sorry one is the affiliate program I already have one David you can message me can you Corey asks can you manually trigger the product layout with a magic command like we can do I mean the if you want my prompt is exposed right here the prompt for the for the product trigger is essentially um David or Corey wants to know if they can just do the the uh um the product layout option using a magic command yeah you definitely can I basically say write two paragraphs you know based on the content I provided about the product um and then write three bullet point lists of product specs pros and cons and that's it that's my prompt right there so you can do it with the magic command if you really want to uh can I set a target audience in their desired outcome in the global background no it's just stuff the global background and all the background stuff is not for um prompts it's just for not stuff the AI does not know Chris asked hey Matt a bit late to the stream sorry if this has been asked already does it matter which AI model for the SEO blog writer will gpt4 give the best result kind of answered this before gpt4's knowledge is greater and you'll also get less what appears to be uh common words used uh I see I use turbo for this one I wish I had some more examples here like for Turbo what I'll find is and you need to understand don't take this the wrong way everybody most of you all right people are not coming back to read other articles that you've written I mean maybe they are but I'm an affiliate marketer people come to my site and they never come back they come they come to my site they want to find something you know they they arrive on my set because they did a a commercial search keyword you know how to buy this particular product or best whatever you know they come to the site they find what they're looking for they click on Amazon they buy the product they never come back again okay who cares if all of my articles have the word therefore at the end of each H2 section it doesn't matter okay I'll know and maybe if I you know if I'm nitpicky okay I don't like that you know but from a reader standpoint who cares what I found is GPT 3.5 will use uh simple words more commonly DaVinci will use more like less simple words more commonly this vocabulary is bigger and then gpt4 will it almost goes in some situations too far and will write extremely professionally and like if I was writing a like a baby a Blog about babies caring for your babies and whatnot I would have to dial in gpt4 using for instance this right in the style of maybe I'd say a uh a mom with a small child now I don't know sometimes there's some magic that goes on behind the scenes with with the AI you know what does this actually mean I don't know okay but this is a situation where the AI might be able to do some magic and it might write uh with gpt4 but using not big words but with a large vocabulary so you might not get the word therefore a lot at the beginning of every section so but at the end of the day I don't think that necessarily matters I think what matters is in isolation does the article read well so it does not do all of your articles you know read differently I would say and isolation is that one article read well hope that answered it uh that was Chris balket asked can I set the target audience in the desired outcome in the global background will it change the output I know we already asked that one and I said no because you can't prompt the AI in the background leader dreams ask can you explain the difference between bulk writer and Penny Arcade as far as output sure uh bulk writer is writing based on titles that the you put in a title here it's going to write an article it's not going to use any background information it's not going to scrape the internet you're just relying on what the AI knows about the subject so if you put something really niche in here like Donald Trump's 2024 court case or something like that you're going to get terrible output because the AI has no knowledge of that okay but if you're going to say how do I rank higher uh using SEO or using backlinks or something you'll get great output now it's probably not going to rank because that's super competitive but the AI will do a good job of writing an article it will be a coherent well-written article Penny Arcade on the other hand is kind of the opposite you're not necessarily feeding it titles you're feeding it URLs and those URLs contain knowledge now the AI may or may not know the content of those URLs already so if you put in a bunch of URLs about um about how to rank higher on Google the AI already knows that stuff but it's just going to use that stuff again to write the article but if you put stuff that we just did like we just did for CNN about Donald Trump's 2024 court date it's going to do a much better job than the penny Arc than the bulk because dependent arcade's actually going to go and pull that data from whatever URL you're citing I don't want to get too much on a tangent off on a tangent for this Penny Arcade but this stuff is these two options are very important right here uh and they'll control how much output you're going to get so definitely read the exhaustive guide for the penny arcade which you can find in the training and help button uh alif asks how do you actually use mid-journey if you go to the training and help guide there is it should be on here yep use mid-journey with zimriter to create custom images so it's all on it's all on there to Mike's point above okay great BB's gonna go see you later Bibi will you add pictures to the writer not right now because they are text files leader asks can you explain the difference between the bulk writer and the penny arcade as far as I think I just did that uh please publish the live stream I'm going to do that um oh Muhammad asks what's the meaning of a log prompt no problem I explained this earlier but you probably just joined us this is going to put your prompt your custom prompt this right here into the title of the article you know up here or into the the header so this is all our stuff up here all right you're going to get the actual prompt you used up here also so if you're playing around with this custom prompt and I recommend like generating five versions of the same article but with different custom prompts and that way you can look at you can open them all up as text files and compare the output all right so maybe you're trying to really dial in that introduction you generate five versions of you know you come in here and you say okay I'm only going to do one H2 all right I'm gonna do one H2 and I'm going to use that custom prompt generate five of those articles with different custom prompts it's really cheap to do with turbo and then you can see which custom prompt they have the custom prompts really affecting the output and choose whatever one you you like best Paul in the I don't I don't do it much I don't do affiliate marketing any much anymore because I'm just spending all my time making zimrider um but let me tell you if I was doing in the past if I had zimrider in the past to do affiliate marketing man it would make my job so much easier I spent hours like maybe 10 hours writing an article you know six to ten a couple different affiliate sites um I'd spend six to ten hours writing an article I do like six products I'd review them look at the specs and all that stuff then I do like the buying guide on how to buy the best product it would take me a long time I basically built zimriter at least the SEO portion to replicate that process and it would save me hours I could probably do an entire affiliate article in 30 minutes without the actual generation I could fill in all the data in 30 minutes no problem now uh no internal links right now are a must I don't know if that's on the roadmap or not there are solutions that already accomplished that right now um so it's in my mind but it's not on the road right now will more languages be added page you can you can output to any language you want right now in terms of input languages that all is in my plans but it's after the Mac version um so right now you can only put the language that you want out so I think that wraps it up we went a little bit about 27 minutes over wanted to just keep answering your questions and give you guys volume hope this was beneficial to you if you did like this video I'd love to do more my my time is limited so if you didn't like it you know then then I won't do more but if you did like it please drop a comment please give a thumbs up but like it share it with your friends that would be interested in learning more about the SEO writer and uh if there's good feedback I'll make some more training videos on the different features of zimriter so thank you all for coming and I will don't worry about that gigger wax don't worry it's uh this will all be made available on the YouTube channel so until next time hey until I talk to you again good luck with your content generation thank you for supporting zimrider and I'll talk to you later
