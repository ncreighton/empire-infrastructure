# Lesson 15 - How to Use Custom Prompts

hey and welcome to your beginner guide
to getting started with custom prompts
inside of Zim writer custom prompts are
incredibly powerful they allow you to
layer your prompts onto my prompts so
then apply your prompts after Z writer
generated the content for a specific
section and completely tailor your
output for your specific needs very
powerful let me show you how it all
works again this is our beginner guide
there's a lot to digest in here so I'm
going to have a more advanced lesson
later on but right now we're just going
to give you that high level overview now
you can use the custom prompt feature in
the bulk writer the SEO writer the penny
arcade and then also the product Roundup
feature but we'll open up the bulk
writer and you can find the custom
prompts in this custom prompt button
right here and this is the area where
you would both create your custom
prompts and apply your custom prompts so
I have a couple in here but before let
me take a step back before we look at
them I want to highly recommend clicking
this button which will take you to this
guide to using custom prompts very
important to read out of all the
different guides this is probably the
most important to read if you're going
to start using custom prompts I don't
just create prompts in Zim writer and
just say I hope they work I test
everything I test everything hundreds of
times if you're going to create custom
prompts and use those custom prompts you
need to be testing your custom prompts
this guide shows you exactly how to do
it it's not hard but you do need to
understand the basics so let me show you
what a custom prompt looks like so we'll
open up this this dog conclusion one so
this is a situation where someone wanted
a call to action like a textual call to
action in their conclusion I think they
had a kennel it's called PBG kennels and
they wanted to mention that people
should reach out if they have any
questions or anything like that so here
is the prompt rewrite the text at an
eighth grade level by using visual
language to evoke emotion while making a
concluding main point mention that the
reader should reach out to PB G kennels
if they need help and then what we can
do is we can say I want to apply this
to the conclusion so prompt for the
conclusion CP dog conclusion and then
you can specify what model you want the
prompt to be applied in so we'll say I
want this to be applied in 3.5 turbo
11106 and now we just leave this and
your custom prompt will now be applied
whenever we write an article that has a
conclusion we can say oh you know what I
want to apply this for the intro also
now we can do that now it's going to
apply for the intro in the conclusion
there's other custom prompts you can
make so let's say remove AI terms
rewrite the text to remove any of these
words if they are present in the text
delve dive maybe you don't want those
words so you say I want everything to
apply the uh the remove AI terms and now
what this is going to do is apply this
prompt everywhere for the intro for the
conclusion for the subheading
transitions product layout key takeaways
FAQs for everything it's going to apply
this prompt now I mentioned testing your
prompts is so critical I explained
exactly how to test your prompts inside
of here this is what I send to open AI I
send a context so I literally you can go
into the playground and test this this
is literally what I put in here all
right I have the context which would be
the article title or subheading title so
if we apply this to the intro the intro
it would Supply the title of the article
if we applied this to a subheading it
would where's our intro it would be the
subheading title for whatever the the
subheading is the text to modify this
would be the text that Zim writer
generated so Zim writer generates the
text first and then it goes back to open
Ai and applies your prompt after it
generated the text and then I say modify
the text according to these rules and
this is where I paste your prompt in and
this is the modify text this is what we
get as a result so as an example this is
what it looks like completely filled
out so we'll take this and I'll paste it
right into the playground if you're not
familiar with the playground is a place
where you can test your prompts because
it's not biased based on previous
generations like chat GPT because you're
having a string of conversations with it
it's biased you never want to develop
your prompts inside a Chad GPT develop
them in the playground and then also I
forgot to mention set this to like a
thousand for the length and set this to
7 don't mess with anything else in here
so the context this is just I was
reviewing some I think flood lights or
something so this is the context H2 and
this is the text it wrote and then this
is the custom prompt rewrite the text in
the style of Dr Seuss and also include a
markdown format bullet list so we click
submit and see what we get so now it's
right in it like Dr
Seuss and it gives us this markdown
bullet list now if you'll see like it
says markdown format bullet list maybe
we don't want that in there all right
maybe we don't want it to say markdown
format bullet list so you come back up
here and you tweak your prompt all right
you tweak it a little bit and then you
delete this and you run it again run it
like 10 times run it like 15 times try
your prompt on different models or just
stick to whatever model you're going to
use in here because your prompt is going
to function on different models test
this thing out because that's exactly
what I do and that gives us that high
quality output inside a zim writer if
you're not testing you're not going to
get good output one more thing
you're allowed to let's see if we go
back to the custom outline feature that
we talked about in the last lesson
there's a way for you to even specify
your custom prompt on a subheading level
CP all your custom prompts have to start
with CP uncore and then your custom
prompt name and so in the SEO writer yes
we have this custom prompt button to
apply custom prompts you can even apply
your custom prompt to your subheadings
so it' be like CP
if we get a prompt named Seuss you could
apply it just like that extremely
extremely powerful we need a much deeper
die but that was just to give you a
taste on what you can do with this I do
have more videos on this right now
