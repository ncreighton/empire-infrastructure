# Lesson 18 - How to Use the SERP Discombobulator

hey and welcome to your getting started
guide with the discombobulator inside of
Zim rer I love saying that word it's a
fun tool you won't use it for every
situation but I want to explain what it
is because you might find a really great
use case for your
situation so before I explain what this
is let me give you the use case all
right so we can go to the bulk writer
for instance and put in some different
titles so these are some different
titles for different types of barbecue
chicken slow cooker barbecue chicken
Southern barbecue chicken zesty slow
cooker barbecue chicken okay so if we
were to write an article about each of
these we'd configure our options and if
we wanted to Ser scrape we'd go into
this option over here and click enable
Sur scraping and then set some different
stuff and then we'd write the Articles
and as it it's writing the Articles what
Z writer will do if you've enabled Ser
scraping is zom writer will use scrape
Al to go out and perform that Google
search find the the best five URLs best
five web pages for that query and the
query would be like for instance recipe
for zesty slow cooker for chicken and
then it would Summarize each of those
five URLs it would use the AI to
Summarize each of those five URLs and
then all of that Ser data and all of
those summaries would be stored into the
database Zim riter has a database it
stores 5,000 of those surp scrapes and
then also 5,000 different scraped URLs
with corresponding summaries okay what
if you wanted to further manipulate that
data that's in the database those
summaries of those URLs corresponding to
each one of these titles okay so again
maybe we've written our blog posts
already but we want to further
manipulate these maybe you want to come
up with some different social media
posts about these particular topics that
you're writing about or maybe you want
to extract some factual information or
maybe you're revisiting these articles
later in time and you want to see if
there's something else that the Ser
talks about now some updated information
that you want to pull some data out from
okay that's where the Ser
discombobulator comes into play well
close this and we'll click on AI Vault
and we'll click on surf discombobulator
there's a directions link up here it
takes you to this page very useful
information okay because we're going to
create custom prompts for this but the
custom prompts are slightly different
than what you're used to okay so this is
the discombobulator and we can put in up
to 250 different search titles now these
search titles would typically be your
blog post titles but basically whatever
you put in here on a new line is going
to be the search query that zom writer
is going to use to go out to Google and
perform that Ser scrape okay so often
these would just be your titles for your
your different articles that you already
wrote all right then you can select up
to two different custom prompts okay so
we don't Define the custom prompts in
here if you want to define the custom
prompts you'll first go into the bulk
writer for instance and you'll set your
C you can Define your custom prompts in
here okay now again we can load custom
prompts for running the bulk writer but
we're not doing that we just want to
Define find our custom prompts save them
to the the database I have two in here I
have recipe write the name of the recipe
in the steps to make it along with
ingredients write only two paragraphs I
think I spelled ingredients wrong and
then so we saved this as CP recipe and I
have another called CP Facebook post
write a Facebook post for the recipe it
should list the exact ingredients in
step-by-step directions to prepare the
dish okay I'm going to leave the bulk
writer we've created our custom prompts
I'll go back into the
discombobulator and we'll put in our
different different titles in here let's
just do two right now since we're on
camera and I want to speed this up and
we can select the different custom
prompt so we'll say
recipe and then I'll say Facebook post
and what this will do is it will take
the aggregate of the the summaries from
those five URLs for each of these title
so sur's great for this got five URLs
did a summary on it aggregated them
together into one giant summary okay it
will run this prompt on that aggregate
summary for this it will run this prompt
on that aggregate summary for this okay
that makes sense if you want to Stack
the prompts you can also do that and
what that will do is maybe you wanted a
first prompt to run on that aggregate
summary and a second prompt just to run
on the result of this prompt right here
okay if you want to do that's when you
would enable prompt stacking you can
read more about it in the directions
link okay if you want the output to be
in non-english that's where you specify
this remember everything needs to be in
English going in but this is where you
can say Okay I want non-english coming
out if you do prompt stack okay only
prompt two the result from prompt two is
going to be in non-english if you don't
prom stack and you put something in here
you'll have a translated version for
each one of these okay you'll give this
a job name and we'll give this like on
camera test okay and we'll say create
discombobulated output and save to
CSV and what it will
do so it's running it and you'll see
this underscore over here in the corner
underscore two means it's running prompt
two underscore one means it's running
prompt
one just comb relating title 2 prompt 2
right now when it's all done you'll see
a little popup up here and and you'll
have a a nice Excel sheet now look
you're going to see some depending on
what your prompt was you might see some
nonsense in here like some stuff that
doesn't make any sense see like these
characters and stuff Excel has a problem
rendering some of these characters so
you'll have to load this stuff up inside
a Google Sheets so I ran this prompt
this setup on these four titles before
the video and here is the result in
Google Sheets okay so we have the the
two paragraphs here and then we have our
recipe re for the Facebook post two
paragraphs here a recipe oops I'm
scrolling too fast two paragraphs here
recipe okay so get this all in your your
CSV file
realize the AI will follow your prompts
better depending on the model that you
choose if you choose turbo or gp4 you'll
get a better better following of your
prompts but if you have a very simple
prompt something very easy then just 3.5
turbo 125 will work just fine for you
trying to think if there's anything else
I want to cover oh yeah
so the let's do this let's go back into
the discom bobul this is the last thing
I want to show
you the custom prompts for the
discombobulator are a little bit
different we'll go to the custom prompt
page now this is what a a normal custom
prompt like in the the bulk writer looks
like when I send it to open AI I have
something called context and the article
title or subheading title the text to
modify all all this stuff this is what
normal custom prompt looks like but when
you create your custom prompts that are
going to be and you create them in the
same place when you create your custom
prompts to be used in the
discombobulator this is what I'm feeding
into open AI right data to process it is
basically the merge summaries of the
five URLs that were scraped and then I
have this instructions bit and this is
where your custom prompt would go okay
so inside do BU
writer custom
prompt Facebook post so this prompt
right here would go right in here and
the summaries from the the merge
summaries from the five different URLs
go right in there and then you get your
results use this in the playground play
with it a little bit I explain how to
get those summaries ahead of time so you
can test this out in the playground and
make sure your prompts are really dialed
in but that's all there is to it
powerful tool you're not going to use it
in every situation every different use
case maybe some of you will never even
use it but I know some of you will
really enjoy using it any questions drop
