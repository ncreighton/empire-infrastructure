# Lesson 3 - How to Rewrite Blog Posts in the Penny Arcade

hey and welcome to your getting started guide with the penny arcade inside of Zim writer this is going to be a high level overview very short video I just want to help you start writing articles using URLs inside of Zoom writer show you how that's all done very simple process so let's just jump in right now you'll find the penny arcade button right here and we can open it up you'll notice this menu looks very similar to the bulk writer but before I I talk about this menu and the stuff in here want to close it and talk high level talk about use case right now there's a lot of different ways to write content inside of Z we've already had a lesson on using the oneclick writer the bulk writer and the SE writer and now we have the penny arcade when are we supposed to use each of these different features the one click and the bulk are really great for writing informational types of Articles whether it's listicles or just general how-to guides the one click in the bulk writer are ideal for those situations now the caveat is in general it's not going to allow you to specify your different outline your different H2S your h3s your h4s you can't really do that with the bulk writer very easily eily but the SEO writer allows you to do just that you can develop your entire outline exactly how you want it in addition you can also provide information that the AI would not normally know about inside of the different background sections for the SEO writer the penny arcade is completely different though the penny arcade does not allow you to provide titles for articles you put the title for the article inside of the one click or the bulk inside of the penny arcade you're going to put URLs so we have the penny arcade right here and I have three different URLs I don't know if you can see that so I'll open up this text file over here and there's these are the three URLs I pasted in here so we have one URL to my site what was it called and here's the article we're going to rewrite top five places in mabi for cultural experiences we have a link to an Amazon product this is a microphone we're going to write a review on this just by pasting the URL and then we have a link to YouTube where we're actually going to have the AI read the transcript R from this YouTube video and write an entire blog post based on that transcript really powerful stuff now in general to rewrite content from a URL you don't need scrape Al and we haven't talked about scrape all yet but it's think of it like a proxy it allows you to to mask your IP and bypass different blockers different ad blockers and whatnot and rewrite content from sites that you would not normally be able to 99% of the time you don't need uh that feature you can just use your own personal IP but to rewrite content from a URL like Amazon or rewrite content from a URL like YouTube you'd need that scrape Al account we'll talk about that later the long and short of it is scrape Al is basically five bucks a month and that's they have different tiered plans but 99% of all Zone writers can get away with a $5 a month plan it's completely optional though if you don't want to scrape YouTube you don't want to scrape Amazon you don't want to scrape Google you don't even need that so so completely optional very very powerful though if you do decide to get it so I've put the three URLs inside of here I've configured some options and then i' press Start Penny Arcade it will say we found three different URLs to write about now I did write all of the articles I had the AI write them all before the beginning of the video and here's the results so this is the top five places in my buy now I did create Word documents for each of these by I showed you this in the previous lesson but this all docs converter this link right here you can drag and drop the Zim writer text files right into it it will create that word document that's really easy to read you don't have to do that if you're just uploading the stuff directly to WordPress but if you are going to edit this outside of Zim writer creating That Word document is very convenient so here is the article top five places in muai now we used GPT 3.5 it's the least expensive model this cost us four pennies to rewrite this article now when we say rewrite it's not spinning the content and you're not going to get the identical number of subheadings what Zim writer is basically doing is summarizing this article and then writing a new article based on that summary so there will be some overlap but it's going to be an entirely new article obviously check for plagiarism but a lot of times it's completely unique there's no plagiarism at all just some similarities but obviously check all that stuff if you start rewriting competitor content so we have top top five places in maai we have some different subheadings in here here some different lists really cool the next article is our microphone review so we put this Amazon URL into the penny arcade and wrote this review for us this review cost us two pennies right here so if you're searching for the Sonic equivalent of a crisp Clear Mountain stream to elevate your content Creation The Blue Snowball ice microphone might just be the answer that's pretty cool so we have this really cool review right here some bullet points and frequently asked questions all kinds of cool stuff cost us two pennies and finally we have our YouTube video that we summarized and wrote an article about this cost us 2 and A2 pennies and here is the article Again the video was about where is the war in Ukraine heading the Ukraine Russian conflict has reached a critical juncture marked by a prolonged stalemate at the front lines the recent surge in Russian aerial attacks blah blah blah what's cool about this is when you're rewriting stuff from the Internet it's going to be very factually accurate if that stuff from the Internet is Al factually accurate so it's a great way to if the AI doesn't know about something to write accurately using those facts from the original article and this is extremely powerful too you might have a a site a YouTube site with a 100 or a thousand different videos you can rewrite all those and turn those into a Blog in no time at all extremely powerful stuff hey if you like this video give it a thumbs up subscribe drop a comment down
