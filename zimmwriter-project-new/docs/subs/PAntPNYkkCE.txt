# Secret AI Trick to Fix Your Grammar + Make Your Writing Pop!

hey let me show you how I've I've ditched grammarly ditched all these other Hemingway app and ditched these other tools that would improve your grammar improve your writing style and all that I just use one tool now I use zimwriter to improve all that stuff I want to show you this technique because it's crazy powerful I've personally been blown away by it I want to share it with you so I've created zimwriter if you don't know about zenwriter it's an AI writing software and I've been so busy creating it I have not had a really good opportunity to actually use it because I'm too busy programming it but I'm making this training on using zimriter and I don't write very well all right my my ability to write I can put words on paper and it can sound coherent okay but it just doesn't pop it's not engaging and whatnot so I've created a command to process what I write to improve the grammar fix all the spelling and whatnot to write in the active tone of voice and then also add contraction so I'll sometimes I'll write like it is instead of it's so it will fix all that stuff for me too it's so simple and I just want to share this with you because it's really cool so here are two things that I wrote right now about these different features in zemwriter okay so don't get confused by that but this is what I wrote and I'm going to Simply select this text and press Ctrl 4. and Ctrl 4 is this special command that I created to again do those things to improve the grammar to use contractions and to change from the I sometimes I'll write in the passive tone of voice it will change that to the active tone of voice which is recommended when you write because it's just more engaging so I've highlighted the text it's going to process that that command and we'll check out the output okay so it pasted the output below and let's check this out so this is what I had initially this is what I wrote and this is what the AI rewrote so this is what I wrote the continue writing trigger is a handy feature in zenwriter by default it's mapped to control two and it's just kind of bland the continue writing trigger in zimwriter is an incredibly useful feature that you can easily activate using control 2. that sounds a lot better that re that Rewritten version sounds a lot better let's look at the second paragraph just like a magic command to activate it simply highlight a paragraph or two of text and press Ctrl 2. zimwriter will then continue writing expanding upon the thought okay that's what I wrote let's see how the AI rewrote it the magic command is simple to use just highlight a paragraph or two and press Ctrl two Zoom writer will then seamlessly continue writing elaborating on the selected idea that's great that actually sounds a lot better I prefer reading that over what I wrote says the same thing it just improved it to make it really pop so let's take this stuff that I wrote I'll just delete that and we'll stick with what the AI rewrote same thing down here the rewrite trigger I wrote about this I'm going to hit Ctrl four run that AI command again to improve the grammar right in the active tone of voice and also add contractions I'm afraid if I share this all with you I'll start writing like me but to be honest this is how a lot of people online will write they're writing the active tone of voice they'll use contractions and they'll write with good grammar so it's a pretty common style all right so this is the output this is the Rewritten version and this is the input so let's read the second paragraph of what I wrote using the rewrite keyboard trigger is just like the other triggers simply highlight the text you want the AI to rewrite press Ctrl 3 and wait for the result this is what the AI rewrote using the keyboard using the rewrite keyboard trigger works just like the other commands simply select the text you want the AI to rewrite press Ctrl 3 and then wait for the outcome it sounds very similar okay the AI didn't change a lot right there let's look at the last paragraph This is what I wrote I don't recommend feeding the AI with more than two to three paragraphs to rewrite at a time otherwise just like the continue writing function you might get a tldr condensed output returned so let's see what the AI rewrote I devise against giving the AI more than two to three paragraphs to rewrite it once as you might receive a condensed tldr output just like with the continue writing function it sounds a little bit better it tweaks some words it sounds a little bit better so let's take that let's take the Rewritten version so simple to do now I'm just using this inside of Wordpress right now but you can do it anywhere like maybe you're writing inside of Microsoft Word yeah you can use this technique inside of there you can actually use this technique inside of grammarly if you really want to but yeah you can use this inside of Facebook inside of Wordpress LinkedIn anywhere you can type text you can use what I'm showing you right here let me show you the actual prompt so you can copy this for yourself so I went into zimwriter I clicked on Advanced triggers and this is the prompt I'm using so rewrite the text to improve the grammar add contractions and write using an active tone of voice it's a very simple prompt okay right rewrite the text to improve the grammar period add contractions period right using an active tone of voice I just threw this together in a few minutes but it really works I really like it then what I did is I assigned it to this this save slot right here I called it rewrite and then I signed it to the control 4 keyboard trigger so I close this and anytime I hit control four on the keyboard it's going to copy the text and then rewrite it reprocess it using the AI for us very cool I just wanted to share that with you because I'm blown away again I have not had a lot a lot of opportunity to use in writer in practice I've been too busy making it but this is just this is really something I wanted to share with you I'd love to hear how you were using it drop a comment down below share this with your friends like the video and feel free to subscribe to the
