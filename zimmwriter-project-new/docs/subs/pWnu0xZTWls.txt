# Unleash the Power of Custom Prompts in ZimmWriter!

I want to share with you a brand new update to Zim riter that has completely overhauled custom prompts and how they work to give you so much more power you can save up to 50 custom prompts inside a zim writer you can apply them wherever you want to the intro conclusion the subsections all different prompts to all those different areas you can also use them as custom variables let me demonstrate how it all works so you can use a custom prompt in the bulk writer and the penny arcade or the SEO writer they all have buttons that look like this custom prompt you'll click to bring up this interface okay now this is the custom prompt editor where you can edit your custom prompt and then you can put a name for it if you want to save it okay so we have a couple saved in here here's a Seuss one rewrite the text like Dr Seuss then I have a shell one that is rewrite the text like shell Silverstein okay these are both I guess shell Silverstein's a poet would you call Dr Seuss a poet I guess he was and then you can decide where you want your different custom prompts to apply so you can say Okay I want Dr Seuss to apply just for the intro but for the subsections I want shell silver steam to apply and that's all you have to do all right because now when you close it it's going to be enabled and we'll have Dr Seuss going for the intro in Shell Silverstein for the different sub subheadings now if you don't like that if you just want to remove these you can either select none for these or you can click clear all and that will clear it all out and disable the custom prompt okay now let's create a new one let me just show you how the interface works so we'll say rewrite the text to shorten sentences longer than eight words while rewriting the text to improve Clarity I know that's an ambiguous term but we'll just run with it and then we'll call this cpor rewrite now you might be asking why I'll click save why why this naming convention why do we have to name it CP these curly brackets cpor for rewrite all right the reason for that is and and by the way you can also now now it's in here so you can apply your rewrite wherever you want the reason we have this naming scheme the curly brackets CP and then underscore and then whatever you want it to be and it can be multiple words too you can say rewrite the text and that can be our our name also the reason we call it this is because if we go over to the custom outline and we load up a custom outline we can actually put this in the custom outline so we can have CP rewrite the text and the reason why you might want to do this is maybe you have different prompts for different things so maybe you're doing like a recipe post or maybe you have an Amazon review and you want a specific prompt for that specific subsection so as an example you have like pros and cons up here you know maybe you want a specific prompt for that that only applies to this particular section it wouldn't apply to other ones you can do that now with the custom variable that you've created you can also use this in inside of the SEO writer so in the SEO writer maybe you have like how to was a dog and it's buy supplies you can say Okay I want my custom prompt to apply right there you can do that too a lot of flexibility with this let's go back to the bulk writer custom prompt you can also select your model by default it's GPT 3.5 turbo we can specify for if you have access to it or Da Vinci if you don't already know this you can write your article with like turbo for instance and then have the different model like GPT 4 using your different prompts now there's one more very important thing I want you guys to read it I hope you've watched the video up to this point because this is the most important point right here see this link to this directions I'm going to click it and open it up and a lot of the different features inside of Zim R have links like this click those links read the directions this one is incredibly important for you to read okay this teaches you what the custom prompts are where you can use them stuff like that but what's most important is I show you you my prompt behind the scenes because this prompt I don't just feed your prompt into open AI what I'll feed in is this I'll feed in context so this is the actual prompt that I'm feeding into open AI with your custom prompt okay so I feed in context and then that's the article title or the subheading title so if you go to the intro and you like put this Seuss thing in right now it's going to it's going to feed this prompt in and the article title will be in here okay and then the text to modify it will actually paste it Zim writer will behind the scenes you won't see this it will paste in the introduction okay then it'll say modify the text according to these rules and this is where a zim writer will paste in your prompt now why this is so important to understand is so you understand how to create your prompt and how to refer to the content that you want Rewritten so let's open up the Dr Seuss one for instance I said rewrite the text like Dr Seuss now the text see I have text to modify so when you put like when you substitute your prompt in here rewrite the text like Dr Seuss GPT 3.5 turbo or GPT 4 or whatever is going to know that you're talking about this section in here which is going to have the introduction so don't have something like this don't have rewrite the introduction like Dr Seuss because the AI is not going to know what the introduction is why because this is what's fed into open AI so again if we're applying this to the introduction if we're applying this custom prompt to the introduction what will be fed into open AI will be this block of text here and it will have context and then it will have the title of the article how to wash a dog for instance and then the text to modify we're applying this to the intro this will be the introduction content and then it will have modify the text according to these rules and that's where your custom prompt will be pasted in okay and then it has the modifi text and you'll get the output in here this applies everywhere so if you go for the subheadings for instance you put in the Shell Silverstein one the context fed in will be the subheading title the text to modify will be the sub that subheading content okay modify the text according to these rules and this will be your prompt so please read this because you'll dramatically improve the quality of your custom prompt knowing what I'm feeding open AI on the back end so that's it I
