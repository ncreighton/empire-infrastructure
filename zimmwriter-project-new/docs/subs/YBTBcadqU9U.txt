# Guide to Using Midjourney with ZimmWriter

hey in this video I'm going to show you how to generate amazing absolutely amazing AI images for your blog posts with zimrider in mid-journey if you're not familiar with mid-journey it is the number one AI image generator in the world and not only that it blows what you can get out of stock photo websites out of the water I've never seen images like this before this is absolutely jaw-dropping I'm going to share that with you because zimriter will actually generate blog posts with a mid-journey prompt at the top of each blog post relevant for the particular article it's very easy to use and get amazing images for your blog post let me demonstrate so there's a couple blog posts I generated about animals this is called the art of animal camouflage how Nature's masters of a disguise evade predators and capture prey so the image that zenwriter generated The Prompt okay like a prompt for chat GPT or a magic command The Prompt is a photo close-up of a chameleon skin morphing in and out of vibrant colors against a leafy backdrop and then there's another article here this is the healing power of animals how our four-legged companions improve our mental and physical health so the prompt here is a photograph of an elderly woman with a gentle smile walking with a contented Labrador and a meadow of wildflowers on a sunny day I'm excited to see what that you know how that's going to turn out the zimrider generated these two prompts for us in these two articles and we are going to generate some AI images with these prompts now we're going to need two things for this the first is mid-journey a mid-journey account you can make a mid-journey account completely for free I believe the free accounts give you 20 Generations a month and then and they don't let you use like if you look at these prompts it will say Dash V and then a space in five so that's like version five of mid-journey that's like the most powerful version if you don't have a if you don't have a paid account you have a free account you can only use version four okay but mid-journey has amazing photos and these are some examples of them I believe a lot of these were generated with the version five with the paid account but you can still get a taste for a feel for it with the free account okay so let's look at some of these like this is a bear diving in the water disaber cub look at the quality of that that's absolutely stunning unbelievable some of these other photos here's a bird like that looks like a real bird it looks like a photograph some of these other things like look at this oh look at this person right here and what's really cool about mid-journey is they'll share the prompts that generated this image so you can study the prompts and learn all right by looking at the images and the prompts that generated them so this is a still from 1976 hit British comedy there's a squirrel on my head the funniest movie ever made look at this girl's eyeballs I could spend hours just looking at some of this stuff this is just insane get the mid Journey account and then what you need to do is create a Discord account now this is the weird part normally a business okay like an AI image generator business you'd go to their website to generate the images that's not what happens here there's a platform called Discord think of it like a chat platform with lots of different groups most of the groups are invite only for whatever reason mid-journey uses Discord as the place we'll go and you'll chat with the mid-journey robot to generate the images I don't know it's weird but that's just how it you know that's the name of the game right now they have the best images in the world these are the Hoops you got to jump through so you make a Discord account and that's completely free you don't have to pay a dime for this and you'll connect your Discord account to your mid-journey account I believe that when you create your create your Discord account first and then create your mid Journey account and I believe when you create your mid-journey account it will like invite you to the mid-journey Discord server or something like that if for whatever reason it does not you can click this little plus here to add a server and join a server and then don't have an invite and you'll see mid Journey right here and you can just join up it's very easy now you can generate your images inside of the mid-journey server so these are all different servers on here you can generate your images in these newbie groups okay and to generate an image all you do is you type backslash or forward slash whatever that is Imagine and then your prompt okay imagine a person walking on the beach at sunset that's literally all you have to do and then you just wait a minute or two for the result to come out now one of the problems with generating your images in these newbie groups are you're generating images with everybody else and forget for a second that other people can see your images who really cares about that there's millions of people generating images right now the problem is your images are going to get lost in the mix it's hard like someone else is generating something down here we've already lost my My Generation up here where is it a person walking on the beach at Sunset and this is not even the busy time during the busy time this is just gonna be scrolling up and up really fast with people generating things long story short generating your images inside of these newbie groups is not really recommended okay I believe on a free account but you definitely on a paid account what you can do is invite and this sounds really wonky you can invite this mid-journey bot okay to a private Channel they call it a private server okay so we're going to create a private server right now add this mid Journey bot to the private server and then it will just be me and the bot and we can both Converse together and create whatever images we want so add a server create my own skip this question we'll call it images and we'll create the server so now this is my images server okay and I can create different channels inside the server but right now what I'm going to do is click back on the mid Journey server created my own server clicking back on the mid Journey server right now going over here to the mid-journey bot and I'm going to click on the mid-journey bot it is a button here called add to server okay so just to reiterate I'm in the majority server again I've already created my images server I'm going to go over here and click on the mid Journey bot click add to server and I'm going to select images so I'm adding the bot now to my images server and it's going to say it's going to read all our stuff that's perfectly fine I'm going to authorize it yes I am a human I'm inviting a robot to my server there we go now if we click back on our images server we'll see the members me and the robot awesome exactly what we want now when I generate images in here there's no one else going to be generating images in here so my images won't get lost okay now people can still see the images that you generate unless you pay extra for a stealth plan and no one can see your images so let's go over here and take these prompts that zimriter generated I'm going to paste them in so I have a paid plan so I'm going to take this version five if you don't have a paid plan you'll want to change this five to a four okay we'll copy this and we'll just paste this right in here now I pasted it and you'll notice nothing happened okay because and this is I don't know this is weird to explain it didn't recognize the command here because I just pasted it so fast you have to paste it in and then you'll it will look like this if it doesn't look like this you're doing something wrong okay so just retry and let's do the other one right now paste it in it didn't catch it I guess I missed that forward slash let's try it again there there it goes now we got it cool so we got our two images generating a photo close-up of the chameleon skin morphing in and out of vibrant colors against a leafy backdrop and then a photograph of an elderly woman with a gentle smile walking with a contented Labrador and a meadow of wildflowers on a sunny day so let's check this out this is 31 percent and this is at 15 percent we'll just wait for it to finish Now by default mid journey is going to generate four different images okay and they're numbered one two three four and that's gonna it's gonna mean something in a second wait till it finishes one two three four okay so here's the results man they all look amazing so you can tell that they're not law we've enlarged this and this is as large as it gets right now so this is not very useful we can't just we could take this and drag it to our desktop and that's perfectly fine but we can't use this for our blog post because it's not high enough quality so there's some options here there's use and then V's again one two three four u means upscale okay so basically get a higher quality of one a higher quality of two higher quality of three higher quality of four we can regenerate all of remaster them and retry the generation or we can also do a variation like maybe we like this one in particular we can do a variation of three that would be three right here or if we like this one that's number one we can do a variation of one I personally like this one right here it looks like he's looking at it this guy's like depressed depressed I like this one so we'll upscale number one all you gotta do is press press that one button right there wait a moment and there will be the upscale version we can enlarge it and now drop it to our desktop and there it is now we've downloaded this photo this is completely unique this has never been generated before there's no copyright on it I can freely use this on my website as a stock image for this blog post very simple let's check the other one out this is the lady walking elaborator wow that's insane which one do you guys like I don't know they all look really good so it looks like she's lost she can't find her dog this looks this one looks nice there's two dogs in here but man that really looks nice so we'll upscale number one and again you can I can click on this to get variations or do a variation on all of them real quick but look at that so we will open a browser and we're just going to drag that to our desktop and there is our free stock photo image that's amazing absolutely amazing so here's the prompt again a photograph of an elderly woman with a gentle smile she's smiling walking with a contented Labrador in a meadow of wildflowers on a sunny day absolutely amazing better than any stock website this is you'd have to pay somebody to go in and Stage this photo right here it's that good absolutely incredible let's go back and look at the variations so again we asked it to do variation we said okay I want you to to regenerate all these four Images kind of do it again for us let's see what we get 93 percent there we go wow oh man this one looks okay but the dog's like freaking huge this looks really good wow two is amazing you could just spend hours on here finding that perfect photo but this stuff is just fantastic for a blog post wow absolutely incredible I still look at what we generated first the most let's look at both of those so there's our chameleon and there's our lady walking the dog incredible hey I hope this demonstrated the power of AI images especially from mid-journey because the quality that you're seeing that you saw here nothing compares to it okay forget all the other AI image generated on the market mid journey is where it's at if you want to use AI images you'll use mid-journey otherwise you use like a stock image website I hope this gave you some ideas on how you could get some awesome images for your blog post again all of the Articles generated by zimrider will have that mid-journey prompt up top there's also I forgot to mention this there's also an option inside of zimrider so you go to the I think it's just in the SEO maybe it's in the bulk also yeah here it is okay it's in the bulk it's also in the SEO blog writer there's an option to have a mid Journey prompt not only at the beginning of the article representing the entire article but also for each H2 some people for each H2 like to have a different image to grab that attention of the reader you could do that too obviously it will take more time to generate each one inside of mid Journey because it's all a manual process but I hope this gave you some ideas because this is exciting I this is like the best time to be alive right now ai images AI blog posts AI videos coming next I can't wait to share
