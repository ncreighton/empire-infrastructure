# ZimmWriter Lesson 11 - How to Connect ZimmWriter to Wordpress

hey in this video I'm going to show you
just how easy it is to connect Zim
writer to Wordpress and start uploading
all kinds of blog posts so the first
thing you want to do is click on the
options menu inside of Zoom writer and
then click on setup
WordPress now with this open you'll see
this directions link click the
directions link it will take you to this
install guide I'm going to cover
everything in this but this is also good
for reference too so the first thing you
need is your WordPress site URL so I
have it here and this is just going to
be the https followed by your domain
name and if your domain uses the www
leave that in if it does not then then
don't add that just have whatever it is
in this little box up here now we don't
want WP admit we're not including that
stuff just it should just end with
whatever your top level extension is
usually it's just now if you do have
your site set up on a subdomain you
should be able to add that too like if
you had like site. your domain that
should also work too from a connection
standpoint the next thing you need is
your WordPress username now you can find
all your users on the left hand tab
there's a user section and all users
you'll find the user that you want to
then give access to you can give access
to your administrator user or to a
secondary user like a VA or something
that's perfectly fine you'll get that
username so our user here is called test
user and then before we enter the
password we need to be very sure that
this user has uh new post creation
Authority so look at the role and then
make sure that this user is either an
author or administrator if it's not one
of those he's you're likely going to get
an error telling you that you cannot
create posts as this user if you do get
that error this is likely the cause so
after you've confirmed that they are uh
either an author or administrator you
scroll down to the app passwords so this
app password is completely different
than the user's password to log into
WordPress okay two different passwords
this allows you to add it's like an open
AI key in that it allows you to add
multiple different passwords for
different apps that you might be using
without compromising your entire user
login so we'll just call this you can
call whatever you want we'll call it ZW
we'll click add new password and just
like open AI you know you copy this
because once you copy it you can never
get it back you can always revoke this
stuff very easily then we'll come over
here and we'll click paste and then all
you have to do is press save new
config it says we successfully created a
test post so we'll go to our posts we'll
do a
refresh test post created there you go
so our connection is now successful and
we can close
this and then go into one of the writers
and click
WordPress and then from the dropdown
select our site and it will take a
second because it's going to contact the
site now and pull out your categories so
we click automotive and then it's going
to pull all the subcategories if any
exist and then you can set subcategory
if you want you can set the article
status if you want you can also set a
schedule an autop publish schedule this
schedule is really awesome it's very
configurable and it's all dependent like
I'm in the bulk writer for instance this
is all dependent on how many titles I
have in here if I just have one title in
here all right then I can schedule oh
where' it go I can schedule that one
title but imagine I had I had a bunch of
titles in here know let's just say
that's 15 titles then it becomes more of
a of an important thing to focus
on so we can say I want three posts to
publish each what each day week or month
we'll say week starting on you pick your
starting date couple years in advance if
you want to and then you can pick your
month you can pick your day now what's
really neat about this is let's say
we've you know we schedule a 100 blog
posts and we we say I went three blog
posts each week starting on this
particular date you can then come back
later after you've you know done this
run and everything's been scheduled and
schedule more blog posts but schedule
them to take effect later on in the year
so maybe you've scheduled out through
September you now want to start
scheduling in October you can easily do
that now very
cool what else uh let's see here now if
you ever need to get in and modify your
stuff modify your WordPress setup it's
really simple to do click on setup
WordPress we can load our saved
site and we can change the user we can
change the password then we can press
update to update it or we can delete the
config at the moment you can have about
10 sites saved in the database and
what's cool is when you quit Zim riter
and then start it back up this is all
permanently saved here so just realize
that whenever you go to one of these new
features in here you'll have to select
what site and select what category you
want to upload this stuff to so that's
it if you have any questions about this
