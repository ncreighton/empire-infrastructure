# Custom Outlines in ZimmWriter Bulk Writer and Penny Arcade

hey I'm so excited to share with you this brand new feature in xermiter called custom outlines it gives you the power to do things that were completely impossible with design writer before this is amazing all right this is groundbreaking but all right but it because it's so powerful it's very easy to mess up so I don't want you to mess up I want you to understand how to use it and how to unlock its full potential for your websites and for your articles that you're generating it doesn't apply to every use case but there's a lot of people with use cases for this that it's going to unlock massive amounts of power for so without further Ado let's dive in let me explain how all this works now you can find the custom outline in the bulk writer and also the penny arcade so you click on bulk writer there's a button called custom out outline and then in the penny arcade you have the same button custom outline now it's not available in the SEO writer for good reason and and this kind of goes to the first kind of training lesson on the custom outline in the SEO writer it allows you to specify the SEO writer allows you to specify your H2S your h3s and your h4s you can go very bespoke with your article but it's slower because you're doing all that manually and then also you can only write one article at a time on the flip side the bulk writer in the penny arcade you can specify all your titles or one URL for each article but you can't specify your actual outline so your outlines up to the AI to generate and that can be hit or miss for some situations so think about this think about a recipe blog post a recipe blog post you probably want so maybe you have a recipe website you probably want some common things in there maybe you're going to have the history of the and I don't know why I hate recipe blog posts because I just want the recipe okay but you know recipe blog posts usually have the history of the recipe maybe they'll tell you some common ingredients for the recipe and then maybe they'll have a couple recipes on that blog post or maybe they'll have one but either way they'll have the recipe they'll have the directions on how to how to bake it or cook it or whatever it is and then they'll give you some tips and tricks maybe on on using that recipe or cooking that that whatever cooking that dish and then they'll have some final closing thoughts or a conclusion or something like that that format that outline format could work for basically any recipe on a recipe blog post or on a recipe website you could talk about tacos and have it follow that format you could have it talk about barbecue ribs and have it follow that format let me show you okay so I have a recipe outline saved so we'll go to recipe one so we have history common ingredients recipe expert tips final thoughts we could talk about barbecue ribs we could talk about tacos we could talk about pulled pork sliders all I can think about is barbecue we could talk about grilled onions we could talk about watermelon recipes or something like that whatever you have you can plug it in here and this outline will work for all of those different formats now let's flip directions and talk about Amazon or product reviews so let's say you're in the the tool Niche here's an outline that could potentially work for that lawnmowers the design of a lawnmower performance product specifications pros and cons FAQs and final verdict that would work for lawn mowers that could work for tape measures that could work for hammers right that could work for baby strollers that could work for car seats so there's a lot of different products that could follow this exact format so that's what custom outline allows you to do it allows you to write many blog posts using the bulk writer or using the penny arcade and have them all follow a common format so let me open up some stuff that I've already generated we're going to look at this recipe example first I'm going to have another video that's going to demonstrate the Amazon example but just so that this video is not too long we're just going to look at the recipe example first so Ultimate Guide to barbecue ribs Ultimate Guide to Pizza Ultimate Guide to Tacos now is this really an ultimate guide no it's really not but I'm just trying to give you an example of how to use this custom outline so I want you to focus more on the outline itself so we'll bring up our outline and I'll bring up recipe one now The Ultimate Guide to barbecue ribs Ultimate Guide to Pizza Ultimate Guide to Tacos I generated all of these with this one outline right here so we'll open up the ribs first and you'll see how this was impossible to do before custom outlines now I use DaVinci for all this you don't have to use DaVinci obviously so we have Ultimate Guide to Pizza Ultimate Guide to barbecue ribs history so Pizza has been around for Centuries with its Origins traced back to ancient Italy barbecue groups have been running for centuries so their history is Rich and interesting in the United States the history of barbecue ribs can be traced back to the late 1700s so we have different content but it's all about the same subheading so the history of barbecue ribs the history of pizza common ingredients so we have cheese Meats possibilities are endless common ingredients when it comes to making delicious ribs there's a few common ingredients you'll need such as brown sugar garlic paprika and then we have a recipe and then we have some expert tips and some final thoughts so see how easy it is with this custom outline to generate very similar outline style articles but with different subject matter let me open up the last one we have the Ultimate Guide to Tacos it's the same thing history common ingredients recipe expert tips final thoughts I want to talk now about how to use this custom outline because this is a free form entry box so it's really easy to to screw stuff up if you're not paying attention first thing I want to direct you to is the directions click this button right up here and it will take you to the custom outline feature directions and by the way this is kind of an aside if you go to the main menu there's a secret training link I gotta close this to get to it click this secret training the secret training will take you to my help page I used to have this button called help in training but then nobody clicked on it because it sounded boring but there's actually a lot of good information on here so I call it secret training now and maybe more people will click on it and go through the training before they ask me questions but you can get to this a custom outline feature from the secret training page but then also from the custom outline area in here so let's first talk about how to create our custom outline so we have our history this is the the recipe example history common ingredients recipe expert tips final thoughts it's as simple as that you just put each outline item on a new line now by default these will be H2S all right everything you put on a new line will become an H2 if you want to make an H3 then what you do is we'll come down here make a new line and put a single Dash like a minus sign so I'll say minus recipe number one and that becomes an H3 number two number three see how simple that is so when the AI writes it's going to create these as h3s and this will then become a transition paragraph transition H2 that will transition into these different h3s right here now what if you want h4s I personally don't use h4s in my blog post but if you wanted to you could say you'd make two dashes two minus signs and then put a little space and say ingredients we'll take that and we'll copy it and put it right down here so now we have two dashes and the two dashes make this ingredients in H4 here's another H4 here's another H4 so we have our H2 rh3 rh4 rh3 rh4 or h3h4 very simple to do this is the same format if I copy that and I go over here to the SEO blog writer this is the very same format that you would use when you use option one so I click copy and it pastes it all in here this is the same formatting that we'll also use so let's go back into our custom outline and we're going to look at recipe two right now so that's the very simple stuff all right we have our h 2s RH threes rh4s but now we're going to get into talking about custom variables and custom variables is where the real magic happens with this custom outline so here's my recipe two if you look I have the history in here common ingredients recipe expert tips final thoughts but I also have these things in pearly braces I have optimized title Auto H3 underscore three optimize title what are these These are custom variables on that help page on the directions page it will show you all of the different variables that you can use and how you should be using them there's no other secret variables inside of zimwriter I will be adding to this over time so definitely check back here with each update but for right now these are the different variables that we have available to us let's start with something very simple let me modify this delete some stuff these variables we're using are advanced the two easiest variables to understand are list and table so with a recipe H2 or you could do this for H3 or H4 it doesn't matter having a bullet list is probably important for a recipe or a table maybe so if we want to prompt I'd say Force the AI to write a table or a list but sometimes depending on the model you choose sometimes turbo is not that smart so you might not get a list or a table with gpt4 you likely will with DaVinci you likely will but with the turbo it's not as it's not as strong it's not as smart it's Hit or Miss sometimes but you can still try it if you want to prompt the AI if you want zoom Rider to prompt the AI to write a table or a list all you'll do is put the curly braces in and then you'll put list and now and you'll click update or save outline or something like that and now this outline right when zimwriter gets to this recipe heading subheading it will prompt the AI to write a list of bullet points a list of numeric items whatever you put in table the generator will prompt the AI to then write a table markdown format table and you can put this wherever you want so we can take table we can put table there now it wouldn't make any sense to probably upload it in history but we could do that if we wanted to we can put it everywhere if we really really want to now there's an option in here called enable lists and enable table so this is the main menu for the bulk blog writer we have that enable list table tables and then also in the penny arcade you have the same thing enable list enable tables first question I get a lot is if I'm using a custom outline that has lists and tables so we have like list should I be clicking these boxes over here I don't recommend clicking these boxes the enable list or enable tables if you're using a custom outline if you're using a custom outline designate where you want the tables in the list to go otherwise what could happen is you probably don't want a table in the final thoughts section but if you click the enable tables you very well could get a table in the final thoughts you probably don't want that again if you're using the custom outlines leave the enable list and leave the enable tables off so that covers the first two variables you can read a little bit more about it in here then there's something called an auto H3 and this is powerful so sometimes you might want some h3s now you can specify your h3s we can say don't burn your pizza uh hook the pizza and a brick oven Etc but the problem is here's the problem this outline we're creating is supposed to apply for all of the different blog post titles so if we're writing a blog post title about barbecue ribs and about pizza and about tacos that that don't burn your pizza has no relevance to Ultimate Guide for tacos the cook the pizza in the brick oven has no relevance to Ultimate Guide to barbecue ribs so how can we get the AI to create some h3s that are relevant to the given title of the article inside of here and that's where this Auto H3 can come in handy so all you do is you'll put in those curly braces again and we'll type in Auto underscore H3 underscore and then a number the number is going to be between 1 and 10 and what that's going to do is generate that many h3s so if we say three when we run this and we gotta we'll have to update the outline or save the new outline if this is the new outline and then we'll enable it when we run this the AI will create three h3s for this particular H2 section and again we can put this wherever we want we can put it here and here I don't recommend putting it everywhere use intelligence when you decide where to put this but now you'll also see this enable H3 button so I'm enabling the outline here so now we've enabled the custom outline and I'm going to enable the h3s auto h3s when I start the bulk writer I'm going to get an error message it's going to say oops you can only enable this button or ADD this prompt in here you can't do both you can't have a custom outline with Auto h3s and then also have this button selected so you got to pick it's like what we just discussed with this enable list enable tables so you're not going to want to choose this all right if you're using your auto h3s inside of your outline in fact you're really not going to want to choose enable h3s if you're using a custom outline in general I don't recommend that you're going to want to manually put this in where you want it so that's your Auto h3s now there's something really cool called YT that stands for YouTube and if you don't already know there is a button over here called YouTube videos and what will happen is if you enable this this option in here Zoom writer by default will find up to three videos one video for the first H2 one video for the third H2 in one video for the fifth H2 from YouTube that are relevant to the article or at least it will try to and then insert those that that's useful I guess if you're not specifying a custom outline but when you're specifying a custom outline you want the YouTube videos to appear in specific subheadings like maybe you you want the YouTube video in the second subheading that's not possible with this YouTube videos button so that's where this YouTube videos variable comes into play so you can put the YouTube video variable wherever you want so we'll put it right here for recipe because that makes sense we want when we're talking about The Ultimate Guide to barbecue ribs zenwriter to go out to YouTube and find a video relevant to a recipe for barbecue ribs all right we could even put it for history and we could go YouTube and maybe there's a YouTube video for Bart the history of barbecue ribs or something like that okay very very powerful you do need scrape Al to use this now there's something very important I need to explain to you zoom writer will not allow you to use this YouTube variable along with enabling YouTube videos you can't do both for the this is the auto insertion at H2 number one H2 number three H2 number five you can't select both but and here's the little very important to remember these other options insert as embed code and then these two options here will still apply and they're intended to still apply when using the custom outline YouTube variable so those were important options but you can still configure those options and they'll these three options insert as embed code and then these two will still apply using the YouTube variable right here but obviously the this enable button will not work and this thing will not work and then finally the optimize title this is the most powerful variable and it's it's a little hard to wrap your head around how it works but once you do the light bulb will go off and you'll be like whoa this is amazing the best way for me to demonstrate what this does is to show you what it gen generated so remember our articles that we generated each one had the identical subheadings history common ingredients recipe expert tips final thoughts from an SEO perspective that's not that good all right it's not going to hurt you but it's not going to help you wouldn't it be better to have it say a history of tacos and then in the context of pizza I would say a history of pizza that would be a lot more helpful so the optimized title allows us to do that so let me open up the outline that I used for the recipe too and let me open up the generated article for recipe two that's this one I'll put them side by side so you can see all right so this is the outline I used and these are the two articles we generated now there's a couple more very there's this Auto H3 in here you can see how that works but we're really focusing mainly on this optimized title and what it did the first H2 is history this is the original outline without the optimized title this is with the optimized title look what it did it said history of pizza so optimize title what's going on behind the scenes is we're making another request to open Ai and we're saying take this title this H2 this history right here take this H2 or H3 whatever it is and rewrite it based on any background information that was supplied now the background is supplied in the penny arcade I'm just telling you that I think up to 1500 words it will look at so up to 1500 words of the background information and then also the title of the article rewrite this heading and so in the bulk writer there's no background so all it had is the title to go on it's a instead of calling this history I'm going to call this history of pizza that's what it did and I think from an SEO perspective that's a lot more beneficial than just history now we also added this Auto H3 feature right here and we have our three h3s origins of pizza styles of pizza popularity of pizza you see how cool it is that would be impossible to do if we specified the h3s inside of this custom outline but by using this Auto H3 and then and specifying three of the AI performed beautifully right here so let's look at the next one the next H2 was common ingredients now we said optimize that title for us so the original article the version without the optimized title gave us exactly what we asked for common ingredients the version with the optimized title gave us common toppings if you think about that what do you do with the pizza you put toppings on it that's actually much more relevant than common ingredients healthy recipe so it changed recipe so here is the recipe to change recipe to healthy recipe Why do they do that just chose to do that and then expert tips we did not optimize that title and we did not optimize final thoughts I'm going to close this I'm going to leave the original one still open and we're going to go to the third example now so this is where we can really go crazy with our options now it's important to watch this video a couple times and then also definitely reread a couple times this instructional guide a lot of what you're going to do with this custom outline is going to take time to figure out how to number one understand it but then figure out how it's going to apply for your specific Niche or types of articles that you're writing this is not you do it one time and Bam you have a the perfect outline for your the AI to follow you it's going to be hit or miss so you'll want to practice with this you'll want to probably use turbo for a lot of your articles so you're not spending a lot of money with gp24 right out the gate so this is the next outline that we used let me open up the result all right so cultural history so it changed history to cultural history now remember before in that last one it had history of pizza so the AI just decided right now to call it cultural history why do they do that it's just what it came up with we still have our three h3s all right our origins of pizza pizza around the world Regional variations common ingredients was changed to Common toppings again popular recipes was changed to popular recipes and styles now if you'll notice this is really interesting this is more of an advanced concept right here I created three h3s or yeah three h3s recipe one I did a single Dash single minus sign and then recipe number one single Dash recipe number two single Dash recipe number three now I played with this for a little bit to see if I could get good output and with DaVinci in this situation I got lucky and and it worked out really well I said first of all optimize this title because I don't want just recipe number one I want the actual uh title of whatever this is for so it said vegan recipe or vegan recipe and then we got a Cheesy recipe and a vegetarian recipe so we have vegan and vegetarian maybe that's twice you can modify that in in your edit stage but that shows you how you can use optimized title to flesh out a list of different things when you don't know what that would possibly be so you can theoretically create a listicle with this but you are going to be limited to the ai's knowledge GPT 3.5 is not as does not have as vast of a knowledge base as gpt4 does now I prompted it to also create a list for each of these recipes so we did get I guess this would be a bullet list maybe this is our bullet list right here but it used these little asterisks for our bullets so we can just fix that we did get a list here and I got a list here cool it worked out pretty well I did also say I want a YouTube video for each one so for the vegan recipe it could not find a YouTube video for whatever reason it tried it couldn't find one for the cheesy recipe it found one so let's actually go to this YouTube page and see what it found it found an advertisement now let's see here all right cheese pizza recipe it's pretty cool and then vegetarian recipes so there's the vegetarian recipe that it found and usually if you're using gutberg if you paste this stuff in it will auto embed these things so homemade vegetarian pizza recipe look at that super easy to do and this has a very high likelihood of boosting your page on time because visitors coming to read about pizza recipes and they they watch this YouTube video they'll be on your page longer and then finally expert tips we optimize the title and then also forced a list in this so expert baking tips that's pretty cool because that's what you're doing you're baking the pizza so tips on baking the pizza and then it created a a list from that pretty awesome um now this is just scratching the surface on what you can do you don't have to just use this for full recipes you can use this for listicles you could use this for tips you could use this for Amazon product post product reviews you're going to have a common review format so anywhere that you can have a that you can have a common format for your art article you have the potential now to use a custom outline and get much better quality output and much more consistent quality output for your website that was a mouthful I encourage you to number one read that that help page where is it that help page a couple times for the custom outlines and go through this video a couple times if you have any questions you can drop them in the comments below you can go to the Facebook group there's ten thousands of writers in the Facebook group that can definitely help you out if I have time I can also drop by and help you out too other than that I'd love to hear how you're using the custom outline to accelerate your content generation game uh please drop a comment and if I don't hear from you good luck with your content generation and I'll talk to you later
