# Lesson 23 - Bulk Generate 10,000 AI Images

so I get this phone call last night and
it's these companies that sell stock
photos and they said Matt I heard you're
working on a feature in Zim writer where
if you press a single button it will
generate hundreds thousands even tens of
thousands of images using Ai and and I
said yeah I'm working on that and they
said if you release that we could all go
out of business and I said so what and I
hung up the phone I'm going to share
that update with you and those events
might have been based on a true story or
inspired by a true story or I might have
been dreaming them but the updates for
real to share with you right now you go
to zoom writer you open up the AI Vault
and there's this button called the bulk
AI image generator before I show you it
I want to show you the the pudding first
the proof is in the pudding so here's
the pudding here are different images I
generated all in batch clicking a single
button all right so this is seven
popular types of magnolia trees and
shrubs these are images that the AI
generated look at those happy dogs under
that beautiful magnolia
tree we get some images this is for
washing a dog how to wash a dog
different images or
that this is for strategies for
Effective lesson planning look at that
dude looks like a real dude drinking his
OJ these are some beaches in the
Philippines I'd love to go I love Clear
Water you like Clear Water love it now
these are mustt tried dishes in Italy
top five dishes got our pasta had our
pizza got some rice with some parsley I
guess I'm assuming those are meatballs
we got
canoli and we have Egypt best places to
visit in
Egypt even got some AI Travelers in
those
images never been to Egypt before I'd
loved to go heard it's hot though all
right so all of these were generated
using AI let me show you how we did it
so I clicked on the bulk image generator
and it brings up this menu and then what
we need to do is we need to enter some
titles or blog post URLs so one of the
titles I entered was how to wash a dog
and those were the the images we saw
over here how to wash a dog I just
entered a title for that you can also
provide URLs so I have this site here a
website and I've used Zim writer to
generate a lot of different articles for
it demonstrate the quality of the type
of articles that Zim writer creates CU
if you don't know Zim writer actually
creates blog posts so these are blog
posts in that are created and I said let
me recreate these images sometimes AI
images have glitches or sometimes you
want to upgrade the quality of the
images so for whatever reason you can
put in a URL and have Zim riter generate
images after the fact for those URLs so
these are the different articles that we
had Zim writer generate I just put them
in like this in
here so we're like remaking images for
these blog posts
and then this is a really cool example I
found this this is University of
Michigan so this is strategies for
Effective lesson planning there's really
no images on here so maybe you have some
blog posts or you have a client that has
blog posts and it doesn't have any
images but you want to add images to it
yeah you can do that so these are the
images that it
generated for this blog post that
doesn't have any
images now with all AI you can get a
glitch here there like it looks like
this is his left hand but it's on right
side of his body so every now and then
you can get a glitch but if you have a
glitch you just generate more images so
we have images for a blog post that
doesn't have any images so I took that
and I pasted it right in here all right
now before we click this create AI
images okay we need a prompt otherwise
we'll get an error message there's a
default prompt that I provide in here
and you can provide your own prompts but
it takes a moment to wrap your head
around what's going
on inside of this output folder
is a text file for each of these groups
of images like how to was a dog for
instance and what's happening is Zim
writer for each of these posts right
here each of these titles or each of
these blog posts it's taking whatever
you put in this box and using it to
generate another prompt and that other
prompt will be used to generate the
image so this right here this prompt is
not used to directly generate the image
it's like it's like the the first step
and the second step is the prompt that
this will generate that's why this says
write a prompt to generate an image
we're not saying generate an image we're
saying write a prompt to generate an
image and the prompt the output from
this you can see right here all right so
this is the text file that's in that
folder we got a text file for each one
of these groups so strategies for
Effective Lessing planning there's a
text file for that and it shows you what
Zim writer
created as the prompt which was then
used to generate the image so recapping
that here is the prompt we put in which
caused for this title Zim writer to
generate this prompt right here and then
this prompt was fed into the AI
depending on what AI you choose and
there's a couple different models
there's Dolly which is an open AI model
and there's different stable diffusion
models from
stability. right so you select the model
that you want and then this prompt gets
fed in automatically all behind the
scenes into that model to generate your
image now you'll notice in here there's
two interesting things in curly brackets
there's the PHR or the word title and
the word subheading what Zim writer will
do behind the scenes is it will take the
title of the blog post or the title that
you put in like how to wash a dog and
replace this placeholder behind the
scenes right with that phrase and then
it will replace subheading with one of
the subheadings that Zim writer
automatically generates behind the
scenes for this it's generating like
different I call them subheadings but
there are different contexts for the
titles that you put in and also the blog
post so you get a variety of different
images so again it used this and it
generated five different prompts and
then fed them all into the AI and
generated those images you can test this
out I I don't want to get too deep in
the woods but you can test this out by
going to something like the playground
platform. open.com go to the playground
and you can paste in your your prompt
tweak your prompt and and test your
prompt you can take your prompt you can
paste it in here you can replace the
title with how to wash a dog the
subtopic of uh find a location to wash
your dog fantastic and then you can
select the model that you want to
generate the prompt
with and so there is our output
and we can take that output and we can
go to something like dream Studio which
uses your stability. a key we can paste
it in here select 16 by9 select four
images and see what the result would be
now this is if we're using comic book
over here when you select stable
diffusion you can choose like comic book
or you can choose photographic go there
it is photographic and we can like click
the button called dream and get the
image result again now all of this is
running I don't want to get again too
too confusing this is running on this
particular model right here which is the
SD model the SDC is more expensive in a
higher quality model the sdt is even a
higher quality and then sd3 is the
highest quality so you can choose what
you want but you can only preview the SD
type of models in this tool but usually
when you use the the the next level up
the SDC the quality will be even better
so this is the how to wash a dog the
photographic
style okay so what you can expect so you
can test out your prompts in dream
Studio to dial this in and and tweak
this to to something that you really
like and then once you've done that
you'll go over here and you'll select
your model that Zim Rider uses to
generate this right here okay to take
this and generate this obviously if you
use GPT 4 Turbo you'll get a higher
quality prompt because it will follow
your directions better
uh but it is a little bit more expensive
and then you want to select how many
images you want per title or URL so over
here I chose five for each of these so
for um this URL the beaches in the
Philippines I got five results for the
dishes in Italy to try I got five
results so you select the number of
images that you want for each of these
you can choose all the way up to 15 and
you might say I want 100 images on the
topic of washing a dog then all you do
is you take that title and you just just
paste it in multiple times and now you
can get a 100 or a thousand or 10,000
different images as many as you want and
then finally there's a button called
compress images if you don't press this
button you'll get just the raw output
from the AI so these are all about three
or 4 megabytes but if you click the
compress image button they'll be reduced
down to about 100 kilobytes which is
great if you want to just upload them
directly to
Wordpress the last thing I want to cover
and I have a a different guide on this
uh but you can find some of the
instructions in this link are loading
these saved prompts so you can type your
own prompt in if you want to you can
also load in the default but there's
others that you can add so I have some
websites here that I could add custom
prompts to and I also have a default
override that we can add to we can't
save them to these different profiles we
can simply load from these profiles or
start from scratch and just type
something in if you want to save some a
prompt to a
profile you'll open up the options menu
in Zim riter and you'll open up the set
AI image prompt and so this is the
default prompt for creating images that
Zim Rider uses and then you can do an
override and here's an override so we
can you know make this 20 and I'll show
you how it will change in a
second and we save the custom prompt and
then when we go back to
the bulk image
generator it pulls from the database the
the updated prompt so we can have an o a
default prompt we can have our default
override prompt and then you can also if
you've added some WordPress sites create
specific prompts for each of your
WordPress sites so Zoom writer allows
you to add like a thousand different
WordPress sites a lot of those sites
might require different styles of images
different types of prompts so once you
dial those prompts in you can save them
in here and then pull them up as you
generate your bulk images but then also
Zim writer if you don't know allows you
to upload your images automatically to
Wordpress and then it will create those
images on the Fly and Associate those
with the blog post and it will use those
settings
from in here if you're uploading to a
specific blog post so if you're
uploading to your site here it will use
whatever custom prompt you have in here
to generate those images to upload them
all like an Inception like Fri your mind
when you try to wrap your head around
all of it but all you need to know is
the bulk image generator it's really
cool way to generate lots and lots of
images you can just use the default
prompt and get great results if you have
any questions drop them in the comments
