# Lesson 12 - How to Create Bulk Product Roundups

if you're an affiliate marketer you
don't want to miss this lesson in this
lesson I'm going to show you how easy it
is to create massive amounts of product
Roundup reviews using Zim riter in no
time at all here's an example of one
this is an article about 10 best coffee
makers for Brewing the perfect cup at
home here's a fantastic AI image cost us
a third of a penny here's a great
introduction right here and then here
are our 10 different products and what's
really neat if you look at this let's
scroll down a little bit more so you can
see all these different
ones if you look at this is actually an
aawp plugin that we're using that Zim
riter is compatible with if you don't
know what that is it allows you to tap
into the Amazon API and dynamically pull
the images the price even the title some
specifics about it a buy button and be
Amazon terms of service compliant Zim
riter does all of this with aawp
automatically all these boxes would be
automatically created if you use a awp
you're not tied just to a WP you can use
any other Amazon API plugin for
WordPress that uses short codes and an
Asin if you don't have any idea what I'm
talking about no worries by default what
would happen is Zim riter would follow
your rules inside of scraping surgeon
and just download the product image to
Zim riter upload it to your WordPress to
locally host the image and at least
you'd have a product image of the the
product obviously follow any copyright
rules and whatnot but going the route
with awp or any other API plugin would
be ideal so here is the review reviews
are very high quality here ideal for
those seeking a versatile Brewing
solution with options for both hot and
cold coffee and tea the ninja cp307
stands out for its advanced technology
and convenient
features there's Advanced thermal flavor
extraction technology with auto IQ
ensures optimal flavor extraction etc
etc so this is best for individuals who
enjoy the convenience of Brewing both
hot and cold coffee and tea with a
single versatile system you get some
pros you get some cons get all the
different products in here then we have
a factors to consider this is like a
buying guide so factors to consider when
choosing coffee makers we have another
AI image here some different factors the
AI came up with and then finally some
frequently asked questions so how do we
create this it's really easy inside of
Zim writer you'll click the AI Vault
you'll click activate product Roundup
and then in here you'll put one or more
plural product names you can have the
word best before them or not it's
totally up to you but they'd be plural
product names and then if you want
Amazon if you want to do Amazon products
you don't necessarily have to specify
URLs you can just have Zim writer find
those URLs for you to then review I'll
show you what I mean in a second but if
you don't want to use Amazon you can
provide your own URLs you can even
provide your own URLs using Amazon if
you want to but it' be like URL one to
Best Buy for instance URL 2 to Circuit
City which is no longer a thing UR URL 3
to you know
whereever you can put up to 15 different
URLs in here manually if you want to and
the cool thing is you don't need scrape
out if you're providing your own URLs
and it's not like to a place like Amazon
or somewhere that's difficult for Zim
Rider scrape now just be aware if you
want to use scraping surgeon and I'm
trying not to get too deep here into the
woods if you want to use scraping
surgeon you will need scrape out we'll
talk all about that kind of stuff in a
later video but let me just show you how
easy this is we'll do one product really
quick wireless headphones I'll click
Start Roundup and I'll have Zim writer
find some URLs for it and right now it's
going to Amazon it's performing the
search and then it's bringing in the
resulting
list all right so here are the different
URLs now this entire thing is not a URL
okay if you look there's this little
separator in here so here is the URL and
here's the title for the product and
this allows you then to go through here
and delete things that are not relevant
and rep prioritize things if you really
want to so you can take all this and
edit inside of here here or you can take
it and and copy it out and paste it in
here and edit in in notepad or something
like that and then copy and paste it
back inside when you're all done all you
do is you configure your option how many
URLs do you want it to process the voice
of everything some different images that
you might want the cool feature is in
the Amazon override when you go in here
you can set some different options first
things first you can set your Amazon
domain so if you wanted to search like
amazon.ca we can click save settings and
if we repr process this start
Roundup all the results are now from
amazon.ca pretty cool huh the other
things you can uh configure in here are
to use a short code instead of
downloading the image and then and
uploading it to your WordPress site you
can disable the call to action that Zim
riter creates so you would no longer
have this call to action button down
here and you can change your tracking ID
by default it's going to use the
tracking ID your your tag your affiliate
tag that's in scraping surgeon if you
don't want to to do that you can
temporarily override it with your own
tag in here then you'd have to enable
that option so really easy to create
massive amounts of product roundups
