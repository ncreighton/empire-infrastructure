# How to Add a Table of Contents to Wordpress in 3 Clicks!

in this video I want to share with you how to easily get a table of contents for all of your blog posts on your entire website in WordPress using a couple clicks of the mouse this is a much better approach than using AI to come up with table of contents or some other means I have had some requests to to demonstrate how we can have the AI to come up with the table of contents but that's not recommended and the reason is that the functionality of a table of contents should be a user clicks on one of those table of content links and it will jump down to whatever H2 or subheading is it corresponds to that link that they clicked on so you can't do that with AI you need HTML to accomplish that let me demonstrate how easy this is okay so this is that website that we made there's a video on it on my channel somewhere we made this for that young lady and it's actually ranking for zimrider keywords right now it's not running for singing but this is a great site to demonstrate on what we're going to do because there's no table of contents for this a user comes for tips to finding your Lo your vocal range they don't know what this article about without scrolling down and looking up at all the different subheadings so we're going to add a table of contents very easily I'll go into the dashboard and I'm going to click plugins add new now there's a lot of different plugins in the WordPress ecosystem a lot of for table of contents some of them are paid some of them are very bloated the one that I like and I use and it's completely free is lucky WordPress and they have a couple different plugins here I'm sure they sell something but this is completely free there's no cost for this so you install it you activate it and then we need to refresh our page so that it appears in the settings so a table of contents is in the settings now and there's some different things you can set how deep do you want the table of contents to go do you want it to go just the h3s let's do that and what's the numeration do you want decimals do you want Roman numbers and then you can call it whatever you want you can say we want the it to be called table of contents we'll save these changes and then you also have to go to the auto insert and make sure that this is enabled otherwise it's not going to appear by default and then you can select the position so we wanted before the first heading and we only want it on post we don't want it on your home page or stuff like that that's literally all you have to do so we'll go back to our post and I'm just going to refresh the page and there is our nice beautiful table of contents so you can hide it you can show it you can click on something that will take you right to where that subheading is let's go to another post so diaphragm control exercises to improve your diaphragm control so it's added this to all of the different pages now if if it's on a page that you don't want it on you can actually go into the edit post and then scroll all the way down I believe I believe there's an option in here too there it is so you can disable the table of contents for this particular page if you want to so very versatile very easy completely free that's it that's all I wanted to show you I hope this video helped I'm encouraging you to go and put a table of contents on your all your different WordPress posts and see if your engagement Rises see if you get boosted in the rankings a little bit Google does love those juicy Links at the front of your post to help the user and help Google understand what your article is about so that's it good luck with your content generation hope this helped and I'll talk to you later
