# Lesson 24 - How to Run ZimmWriter on Mac (Using UTM)

so this video I want to talk about how
to get Zim Rider running on a Mac we had
a user Jeff Jenkins today ask about
using Zim Rider with UTM I had a video I
made about UTM and he was running into
an issue so I want to refresh that video
we're going to specifically look at
using UTM which is like parallels but
it's free to run Zim Rider let me give
you the high level overview on running
Zim Rider on a Mac right now because
there's a lot of different ways to go
about it right now I record all my
videos for for my my YouTube channel on
on a Mac and I'll I'll do that with
something called parallels parallels is
essentially a a virtualized version of
Windows full blown Windows runs on my
Mac computer I can run all of my windows
applications it's very fast it's very
smooth the speed is going to depend on
the the type of Mac you have I'm running
an M2 Mac right now very fast I have no
issues running Zim Rider I can just open
up Zim riter it runs no problem
whatsoever I'll use this to to record
all my videos I'm here in Windows but
I'm I'm on my Mac this is how I prefer
to run Zim Rider on my Mac because I'm
making videos if I wasn't making videos
I just wanted to write blog posts I
probably would not go through the
trouble of using parallels what I would
probably use is something called whiskey
whiskey only runs on an M series Mac so
M1 M2 M3 M4 all right and you can
containerize different Windows
applications and Whiskey's free
parallels is 100 a year Whiskey's
completely free you can go to get
whiskey. download the latest version I
have a video on this go to my site
ranking Tac click on secret training
scroll down to this big big playlist and
at the bottom you'll see this complete
step-by-step guide on setting up whiskey
you set up whiskey install Zim riter and
then you can use Zim Rider on your
computer the only thing you don't get
working is Magic commands because whiski
can't access the clipboard copy and
paste like you could in Windows so if
you want to use magic command this is
not how you're going to do it but this
will run everything else it will run
your bulk writer your penny arcade your
SEO writer basically you get a a native
Mac experience with Zim riter it's also
very low resource uh usage so that's
another way to to run Zim writer on a
Mac right now now the other way is
through something called UTM UTM is just
like parallels it's like a virtualized
containerized Windows Experience but
it's completely free now because it's
free there's some quality of life stuff
that is not as userfriendly as you would
get through something like parallels but
we'll go ahead and set up UTM and get it
working on here the first thing you want
to do is go to Google and type in get
UTM Mac you'll want to download the file
or you can get it on the Mac Store the
Mac Store is $10 and that's just to
support the developers you can just
download it from right here but you'll
download that and you'll also need an
application let's open up the app store
called Crystal
Fetch and this this is going to download
the actual Windows um ISO file like the
image file of windows it's free you'll
want to download this and open it up I
have UTM open here and Crystal fetch
open here first thing you want to do is
in Crystal fetch you want to select
Windows 11 and then whatever
architecture you're running on so if you
have an M series Mac select Apple
silicon if you have an Intel Mac select
this once you've made your selections
click download it's going to download
the windows ISO file and you'll want to
put it some where I'm putting it you I'm
making like a download because you're
going to want to keep this if you delete
this ISO file UTM will no longer work so
I made a little directory called UTM and
I moved the file in here don't rename
the file just leave it as is here's the
ISO file that Crystal fetch downloaded
now we go into UTM itself click create a
new virtual machine and we are going to
virtualize remember this will not work
if you selected the wrong architecture
I'm on an M series Mac so downloaded the
Apple silicon one if you're on Intel you
want to download the Intel one so I'm
going to click Windows because that's
what I want to install I want to install
Windows or higher I want to browse for
this ISO file and we will not check this
box we'll leave this unchecked there's
also there's a install guide here if you
want to read more about it we'll just
click continue we want to give it a
healthy amount of ram so 8192 for 8 GB I
found 4 GB just not work that well and
we'll give this this you don't have to
give it 64 gigs but maybe like 48 gigs
of disk space cuz Windows does take a
little bit to install and then finally
our share directory because we want to
be able to access files like share files
between our downloads folder and our UTM
install so I'm going to just select my
downloads folder and click continue and
click save so now it's made my little
Windows UTM instance I'll press play now
this is going to come up you're going to
see something that says press a key when
that happens you press enter if you
don't press enter it junks up and you'll
have to press the red button and close
it and retry
it if you get any other error message or
or like problems or something you
probably did something wrong so just
rewind the video and do everything that
I showed you uh step by step and and it
should work just fine for you otherwise
you'll get the the issue that Jeff's
having which is like this thing right
here let's go over here click next we
have window is running now we're just
going through the setup I don't have a
product key we're going to do Windows
Home click I accept I was doing the
install so I can close a lot of these
windows I don't need Crystal fetch open
anymore if I just wanted to write blog
posts and I had an M series Mac I would
just use whiskey it's so easy to get up
and running you can install other
windows applications with it
too I'll cut the video and we'll come
back when this thing's completely done I
think we're in the home stretch here
we're not going to press anything we're
going to let it do its thing see what's
nice about whiskey is you don't have to
do any of this stuff right you just
literally install whiskey and then it
gives you like you just we'll follow my
video but then you can just install Zone
Rider you don't have to go through any
of this stuff it's a lot quicker but
again it only works on an M series Mac
Windows just takes forever to set
up
finally look at that now when this first
starts up it's going to ask you to do
this guest tools I think the guest tools
is going to enable copying and pasting
between Windows and your
Mac let's reboot
now so when you boot this thing up from
now on you're not going to press any
Keys over here because you're not
booting from your CD or your DVD you're
just going to let it boot from the
virtual hard drive I'll show you
something really cool we'll actually
duplicate this and make like a second
version a second virtualized instance
once you go through the whole trouble of
setting this all up duplicating the
virtual instances is actually very easy
so we should have everything up and
working now let's try
notepad now I don't have Windows
activated but I think you can just
continue to use it without being
activated so let's copy from here paste
it works I thought the keyboard the keys
are different though
so so yeah copy and paste Works
phenomenal let's check for our shared
folders click on this PC my network Z
Drive is my downloads folder that we
shared with our setup we select the
downloads fold folder if you didn't you
can come into the virtualized instance
and change your directory now we can
copy and and move stuff between our two
instances let's copy
this and move it to our downloads
folder we're just going to unzip this
finally we have Zim
riter fantastic so Zim riter is now set
up on this virtual instance of windows
and again the benefit of this over
something like parallels is it's
completely free so let me shut this down
then I'll show you something really cool
so we'll shut down I can actually
clone
yes and we can
edit call this
Windows two and I guess there's other
options you can configure in here lots
of different options you can
configure and then we'll edit this one
right here
we'll call this Windows
[Music]
one cool so we have like two virtualized
instances so
theoretically I should be able to open
up both of them if you want to use Zim
riter this way you you'd need two
licenses because it's still going to be
pinging the gumroad server you don't
want to be in a situation where your
license will get revoked but this is a
way to run multiple versions of Windows
simultaneously I think parallels really
is a lot faster for the initial startup
I don't know if it's going slower here
because I'm running two instances but
the parallel startup is a lot
faster we
have two versions of Windows running
simultaneously let me just start one of
them up at a time to see if it actually
runs faster maybe it was going slower
because I was running two let's just run
one yeah it's going a little bit faster
with just one instance that's how you
can get Zim Rider in and virtually any
other windows application running on a
Mac without too much trouble and start
generating lots of Articles if this
video was useful to you drop a comment
down below subscribe all that good stuff
and then obviously pray for that day
that we have the native version of Zim
riter which would even be more powerful
than what exists right now running on a
Mac and windows simultaneously so that's
all I got don't forget also to check out
my 8 hour YouTube course on creating uh
a WordPress website from scratch that's
all in the description link down below
good luck with using Zim riter and I
will talk to you later
