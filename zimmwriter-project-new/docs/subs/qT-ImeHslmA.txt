# 1-Click Amazon Reviews + WordPress Uploads + Images + Affiliate Links!

wouldn't it be cool if if you're into affiliate marketing to go to Amazon or Home Depot or Best Buy and then collect up to a thousand URLs put those URLs into some AI writing software press a couple buttons and then get up to a thousand product reviews uploaded automatically to your WordPress site with your call to action with your affiliate link with a relevant YouTube video about the product and with the images formatted properly that'd be pretty cool let me demonstrate how to do that with Zim writer it's super easy now to do this we'll need writer we'll also need a scrape Al API key and we'll also need open AI both are very easy to get very inexpensive so we're going to open up Penny Arcade I'll move it right over here and then I have a couple different cordless drills in here just for sake of time we're just going to do one I'll take the URL and I'll just paste it in here you don't need to mess with any anything special in here because I already have my WordPress site set up in here I already have my Amazon affiliate code set up in here it's all done for you once you configure those options the first time so we have our URL now what I want to do is I'm going to disable this option and use a custom outline usually when I'm writing a product review I don't want the AI just to come up with the outline I'd rather have it follow a template for a product review or for a recipe or something there's very like standardized templates you can have it follow so I built a custom outline and here it is you can copy it if you want although you can create these yourself Zim writer gives you that flexibility so it's going to create an H2 that says over view but then it's going to optimize that for the title itself it's going to throw in a YouTube video that it finds it's going to go to YouTube find that YouTube video it's going to uh get some detailed features and then add a call to action below that little button with our link to the product with our affiliate tag it's going to do some pros and cons and some concluding Thoughts with another call to action there so we're going to use that outline and then we're going to link up our WordPress site now I only have one site in here this is a throwaway site that I made for AI testing but you can put in up to 10 different WordPress websites and you can select how you want it to be published as a draft I chose that and then we don't have to click this button to add YouTube videos you would normally need to if you're not using a custom outline but our custom outline is using the YouTube trigger the YouTube variable in here so we don't need to click that button okay and then we just configure our options so all this is going to be overridden now because we're using that custom outline I'll choose a second person voice actually let's do a first person plural voice a we us our we do literary devices lists tables key takeaways I want to do short answer FAQs I'm going to do Outlaw personality because people that use drills Builders and stuff like that they're all like ah rough and tough so we'll do Outlaw I'm stereotyping here okay forgive me and we're going to do auto style we're going to keep this cheap but and use GPT 3.5 turbo we don't need the image API because we're using Amazon and we're going to pull the image from Amazon we will disable the inclusion and that's all we need so I'll click Start Penny Arcade and we'll just I'll Speed the video up and we'll watch it work now here's the site it's going to upload it to it's going to be all automatic we don't really need to do anything and that's it now I again I could have queued up to a thousand different URLs if I really wanted to but we're just doing one for for sake of time and I'll just uh watch it work and we'll see the results okay the article is done let's go to our WordPress site and refresh it and there it is all right let's preview it okay so here's the article now it downloads the image from they're usually manufacturer images if you don't want that because you got to follow all the licensing and and and whatnot and copyright rules if you don't want to do that you can disable that and you can either embed the images if you're allowed to do that or you can use the Amazon API whatever you want just follow all the rules here here is the title here's our intro now this table of contents is just a WordPress plugin it's called I think WP lucky it's a free WordPress plugin I have I really like it here's our key takeaways now here is our first H2 and our video that the AI found so this is actually about the product yeah about the product itself sometimes you'll get the product sometimes you'll get something related to it but by embedding a YouTube video this is a great way to boost that page on time and then hopefully increase your rankings because you're not people aren't bouncing from your article to go find another article they'll be like oh hey I really want to learn about this drill they'll watch the video and then learn more about it so there's our first uh subsection here's our next subsection now here is our call to action if you look down there if you look at the bottom you'll see my my Amazon affiliate code so we can just double click on this it will open up the page and it has our affiliate code already added right there yeah so it already adds our affiliate code to all these products very simple to do pros and cons some concluding thoughts and then we remember we use that custom outline so we told it to add another call to action right under here the custom outline Super powerful you can add YouTube videos wherever you want call to actions wherever you want makes it very easy and then we have our frequently asked questions the short version we didn't choose the long version so that's it our article is now done and I encourage you to pause the video and actually read this because one of the cool things about Zim writer is the quality of the output uh very cool that's all
