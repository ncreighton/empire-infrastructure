# Lesson 8 - Getting Started with ScrapeOwl

in this lesson we're going to talk all about scrape outl I'm going to explain what it is how it works answer the question of whether or not you even need it and then show you how to get all set up with it so high level do you need scrape out no you don't need scrape out but there are some functions inside of Z writer that require it if you want to uh scrape a YouTube transcript you want to scrape and bring in YouTube videos into your articles like a an ined of a YouTube video yeah you'll need scrape out for that you want to scrape Amazon you'll need scrape out for that you want to Google Sur scrape there's features that g writer will then go to the Ser bring in the top 10 results analyze those for SEO boosts and whatnot and factual information you'll need scrape out for that there's also a feature I created called scraping surgeon that allows you to surgically isolate information on a page that you want scraped you'll need scrape out for that and then finally there might be some problematic URLs I don't get too technical but some URLs that would render things that would require a chrome instance to actually run and render the content so the JavaScript gets merged into the content and actually rendered at runtime you'll need scrape out for that too that because that's one of the features that scrape out does so you don't need scrape out but there are some features that require it inside of Zim Rider now how do you get set up with scrape out let me switch screens here here we go you'll click the options menu and you'll click setup scrape out let me move this over here now you'll see a bunch of stuff in here don't worry about this we'll cover all this stuff later you're not going to see anything when you first open up Zim riter you won't see any of this stuff uh we'll talk about that later in the advanced video you'll see first of all this directions link click the directions link read the directions directions are important it explains some different things in here now look this is a magical button it legit is a magical button if you go to scrape out.com so scrap out.com and you click pricing this is what you're going to see $29 plans a month $99 plans a month 95% of you don't need these plans right but this is the going rate for most most of these scraping products like scrape all but I negotiated a special deal just for you guys it's not an affiliate deal I don't make a single dime on this they cut a special deal just for Zim writer people if you click this button it will open a page and then when you click pricing you see these new magical plans that are hidden and only visible for Zim writer users 95% of all zom riter users can get away with this plan right here five bucks a month it's a monthly plan it's not pay as you go but it's insanely cheap for what you're doing again scrape B is not required not necessary all right but some features inside of Zoom writer do need it I recommend starting the free trial in this they'll give you you don't even need a credit card you start the free trial they give you a th000 free credits you can see if this is something that's important to you and then after your free trial is over I think after 30 days or after you use all your credits you'll be asked to enter your credit card and then you can pick the I think you have to pick the $5 plan again they'll show you what to do if you you ever have any issues with the plans you just reach out to the scrape out team they're a great group of people okay so you you click the button to buy the key you'll get the key you'll go into your account it will give you an API key just how you just like how you got an API key for for open AI same concept they give you an API key so you click the button you'd enter your your scrape out API key you click okay it would validate it and then you'd be all ready to go now there's a an option down here a check boox down here and this is important if you do the free trial over here or maybe you subscribe and you no longer want to subscribe anymore if your subscription for scrape out Runs Out Zim riter will keep trying to use your API key and it will throw an error so you'd come over here and you temporarily disable your scrape Al key this will make it so zerrer will not try to use scrape Al anymore it will just try to use your IP when scraping this is also useful if you're trying to somehow conserve credits for the month and you're not scraping Amazon or Google or YouTube or whatever you're just scraping some normal sites in those situations maybe you don't need scrape out so you can come in here and just temporarily disable the usage of it to save some credits we'll talk about all the other complex stuff down here later on in a different video but that's just how to get started how to get set up with zom writer and now once you've entered all that information anytime you scrape something whether it's in the penny arcade you're putting URLs in uh you're selecting YouTube videos you're let's see you're using Ser scraping it will then use your scrape Al account you can go into your scrap Al account and check your credits and all that stuff so
