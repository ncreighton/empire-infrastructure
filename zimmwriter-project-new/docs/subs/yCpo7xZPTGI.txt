# Bulk Rewrite Internet Content (Up to 1,000 URLs at a Time)!

I'm going to demonstrate something that's going to blow your mind it is it's bleeding edge AI we're going to take up to a thousand URLs a thousand different links to web pages I'm going to paste them in to some AI writing software I'm going to press one button and the AI writing software will go to each of those links each of those urls crawl the data summarize the data and then write an article based on that data so if you feed a thousand different links a thousand different URLs you could get up to a thousand different New pieces of content let me demonstrate so the software we're going to be using is called zimrider it's AI writing software does a lot of different things we're going to look specifically at this Penny Arcade feature that allows us to do this rewriting of content on the internet so here is the input box where we can paste each URL on a new line so we can simply go over here to a website and we can take the URL and paste it in there and then press Start Penny Arcade that's literally all you have to do if you want multiple URLs you can just put the next URL on the next line but let's get fancy let's do a lot of URL if I don't want to put things in manually I can look for a site map most websites will publish site maps and you'll have to find the url for the site map for this particular site here is the URL for this site map and we'll have a link to all the different posts on the website now I can't just take these and paste them right into here because it's going to append the time code to the end of the URL it will confuse the software so we need to parse out the URLs very very easy to do go to Google and type in sitemap url extractor first link is this SC SEL I guess and then we need our URL for the sitemap so here's the site map I'll go back over here I'll paste in the link to it I'm gonna load the sitemap and here are all the links now extracted so let's take the first like four or five all right and we'll go over here to Penny Arcade we'll paste them in now there's some different settings but we can choose and this kind of goes outside the scope of this video but you can choose the voice I'm going to let the AI determine the voice based on the content of each uh URL we're going to do literary devices I'm going to put on lists we'll do tables let's have some short answer FAQs also based on the crawled and summarized data we'll do auto style and have the AI come up with some SEO keywords that's it let's just click Start Penny Arcade and we'll sit back watch this thing run I'll speed up the video and we'll check out the results okay our articles are now done and they're in the output folder inside of zimrider and if you open them up their text files and they're in something called markdown format and you can paste these directly into WordPress if you use Gutenberg and it will automatically convert the double hashtags to H2S and whatnot if you don't use that or you want to edit it you can take these documents and put them into something like a markdown converter here's a URL to one of them let's just drop one in here to check it out really quick right now I'll open up the the resulting file so here's what it generated okay here's the original URL and I'm going to make all these files available for you I'll put them in the description below so you can easily review them at your leisure but here is the original URL and here is the Rewritten article it used GPT 3.5 turbo and it costs three pennies now the reason I call this the penny arcade is because all of the articles that you generate inside of here cost just pennies we're talking like 2 cents to seven cents a very inexpensive way to generate massive amounts of content fast so here's the different settings here's an image prompt if you use something called mid-journey it generates an AI image so here's your prompt to get that done here's your meta description here's the title of the article master your pitch daily exercises for accurate singing and then we have some subheadings that the AI came up with based on that analysis of that particular URL and we can actually go to the URL right now let's go there and we'll compare just uh check it out I think you'll get a kick out of this all right so here's what we have so here was like the first H2 for instance warm-up exercises for improved pitch and accuracy importance of pitch accuracy so it's a completely different H2 exercises and techniques visualization techniques so it's using the summary that the AI generated from this article to rewrite the article use different headings talk about different things but still use the data still use that Source information so that is using competitor urls using URLs to then rewrite articles you can and you can pull these URLs from anywhere you can get them from news sites you can get them from websites basically wherever now the other thing you can do is go back into Penny Arcade and we can actually go to YouTube so here is a video I'm hit on YouTube there's a Google product review update I can actually go over here what there we go I'm going to make it a little bit bigger there's some three dots over here I'll click Three Dots and I'll say show transcript and here's the transcript for the YouTube video now I'll click these three dots and I'll toggle the time stamps off I'll take this entire thing and let's actually just scroll down and select it all copy it all and I will go over here and paste the entire transcript in so here's the entire transcript so just to show you again let's go back to the video so we went to these three dots we clicked show transcript and it appeared up here and then we toggled the timestamps off then we selected the entire transcript and then we went back to the petting arcade and pasted the entire thing in now for this situation we'll turn off literary devices we'll leave the short answer faq1 we'll use uh automatic keywords and leave it at that so start pinning arcade now what it's going to actually do is it's going to write an article or based on that YouTube video so just one more time it's taking the entire script from that YouTube video and it's going to write an article for us now expand your mind a little bit okay you can do this for basically any big blurb of text you can rewrite a school paper if you want to you can rewrite anything any text you can highlight and then paste in it will basically create an article out of that all you have to do is paste it into the penny arcade very simple now we'll let this thing run I'll Speed the video up and then we'll check out the result okay the article is now done again we just generated an article using the script the transcript from a YouTube video let's go to the all docs converter again and we'll put this through to view an easier to read version all right so again here is the original YouTube video and here's what we got so this cost me 10 cents okay 10 pennies mastering high quality product reviews Google's new guidance on AI content writing effective reviews Google's best practices so let's read one of these applying best practices and evaluated products and services from a user's perspective and demonstrating knowledge through evidence such as visuals audios and links are emphasized in Google's recent guidelines on writing high quality reviews the search engine giant stresses The Importance of Being an expert in providing evidence to support expertise as well as considering the perspective of picky buyers when writing reviews to reinforce the authenticity of a review Google recommends sharing quantitative measurements about how something measures up in various categories etc etc and we even got a table in here and we have some FAQs so all of this the AI did not know all right this was an update from April 2023 so it's actually using stuff from the transcript it's using that information likewise you paste those URLs into the penny arcade you paste these URLs in here it's actually going to go out to those web pages crawl that data summarize the data and then write using that data so if you're referencing a very fact intensive or fact specific URL it's going to use that data in the article it writes let's talk about a couple more things with this Penny Arcade there are some limitations number one it will not work very well in product Roundup posts so if you have a product Roundup post like the top 10 lawnmowers for 2023 it's not going to work very well the max number of H2S you're going to get out of this is going to be about five it is going to vary depending on the input length of the article that it's summarizing but for the most part you're not going to get what you expect from a product Roundup post also it's not going to do very well on a long listical post so top 20 things to do before you hit the bucket it's not going to do very well now it might do well on on top five things or top 10 things to do before you kick the bucket don't kick the bucket by the way but it might do a lot better on those listicles with fewer items in them it's not going to write a terrible article but you're not going to get 51 things to do or 30 things to do before you kick the bucket and then finally you need to be careful with these settings in here if you are let's go let's say you you're feeding in some URLs from a news site and you select literary devices then the article is not going to come out sounding like a news article it's going to start using metaphors and similes and things like that which are not commonly used when talking in a professional tone of voice about a news item so you'd probably disable this so you might have an FAQ you might leave the again talking about new stuff here you might leave the audience personality off you're not going to select a second person for a news article maybe it's like professional or maybe you'd leave it on automatic so you're gonna have to play with the settings depending on your particular Niche there's billions of web pages out there and all of those web pages have different styles of writing and whatnot so before you just start queuing up hundreds and hundreds of URLs do some tests first to get it how you want it again this is not a Magic Bullet this is not a one size fits all it does everything for you this is just another tool in the toolbox of zimriter if
