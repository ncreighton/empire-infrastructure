# Lesson 14 - How to Use Custom Outlines

hey and welcome to your beginner lesson
on getting started with custom outlines
inside of Zim Rider this is just a
beginner lesson because we can do such a
deeper dive on this I'm going to do that
later in a more advanced lesson but
there is so much power with this feature
and this is something that as far as I
know is not available in any other AI
writer on the planet this is extreme
power just for Zoom writer users let me
show you because I think showing you is
better than trying to explain it you can
find the custom outline feature in the
bulk writer and then also the penny
arcade so I'll click on the bulk writer
you'll see this option over here called
custom
outline and you can save your different
custom outlines and there's some uh
directions up here but definitely click
this directions link it'll bring you to
this page there's this is such a
technical feature but it's easy to
figure out I'm just saying technical in
that you need to read directions before
you start using custom outlines read the
directions because there's a time and a
place for it and there's so much power
in it so let me explain what a custom
outline is so a custom outline is
something that you would want to apply
when you have a lot of blog posts that
you want to follow the same outline
format so we have these three articles
in here hearty winter warmth classic
beef stew recipe summer Delight
refreshing watermelon and feta salad
dectin dessert triple chocolate lava
cake made easy so three different recipe
posts but we want them all to follow a
common format a common outline format so
that would be a situation where we' use
a custom outline so here's an example of
the the three articles we wrote Deon
dessert this is the triple chocolate
great AI image by the way now look down
here the first H2 is origin of lava cake
the first H2 for this stew recipe is
stew Origins the first H2 is origins of
watermelon salad so I'm telling the AI
that I want some kind of an origins or a
history to be the first H2 so you can
see right in here our custom outline
history is our first H2 but but we want
to use this variable this custom
variable which is
explained let's see right here to modify
this H2 into something more relevant to
the article being written if that makes
sense now we could just leave this out
if we want to we could just leave this
out and then every article will have the
first H2 be history we want to leave
that in we're also telling the AI that
for every first stage two we want a
YouTube video so we have a YouTube video
Here YouTube video Here YouTube video
here the next H2 we want in these is
something to deal with the common
ingredients for this recipe but again
we're going to optimize the title so
it's not going to be exactly the phrase
common ingredients so essential lava
cake
components Essentials to
components essential salad components
and we want a table for each of these so
we have a table here here have a table
here we have a table here then we want
the actual recipe but again we're going
to optimize the title here the actual
recipe is step-by-step baking
instructions step-by-step cooking
instructions stepbystep assembly and
it's cool that it knows that we're
assembling a salad we're cooking the
stew and we're baking the cake we also
want an AI image an image for each of
these so here's our image here then we
want some expert tips but we want the
expert tips to transition into three h3s
there's another variable we're using
here we go up here this is a variable
Auto H3 and then the number is replaced
with the number of h3s you want we want
three h3s so if we look in here let's go
back and put the table of contents it's
easier to see expert tips so it's
exactly what we put because we're not
optimizing the title and we want three
h3s under there 1 2 3 let's go over here
to this table of contents we have expert
tips one two 3 three
h3s go back up here expert tips one two
3 three h3s and then finally we want
some final thoughts down here final
thoughts for each of these final
thoughts that is the power of a custom
outline let me show you one more that's
for recipes let me go top five so this
is top five a little bit more in depth
let's see top five over here top five
places in Tokyo for technology
enthusiasts
we have the first place and then we have
an overview and then two a main
attraction with an optimized title and a
tips optimized title so man attraction
tips so this is top five places in Tokyo
top five places in Rome top five places
in New York see how that works you can
even do Amazon reviews now we wouldn't
do Amazon reviews in the bulk writer you
would come over to the penny arcade you
put in a bunch of Amazon product pages
you go to custom outline and this would
we'd have an overview section with an
optimized title call to action you can
learn about the call to
action here with your affiliate tag put
your affiliate tag in there features
with another call to action pros and
cons these are h3s a Pros with a list a
Cons with a list performance optimize
the title final Thoughts with our
closing call to action and this doesn't
have to be Amazon you can do any product
page you want to so this feature is
extremely powerful very underused
underutilized feature but very powerful
