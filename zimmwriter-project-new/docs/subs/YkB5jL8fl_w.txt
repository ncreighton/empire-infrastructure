# Lesson 19 - How to Use the Text Discombobulator

and welcome to your getting started
guide with the text discombobulator
inside of zenwriter it's a mouthful it
sounds complicated it's a little hard to
explain but I think if I demonstrate an
example it will make a lot of sense to
you let me show you how it works so
we're g to not talk about the text
discombobulator first we're going to
talk about the problem I'm trying to
solve so the problem I'm trying to solve
is I have these these keywords here but
these keywords are actually categories
on my SEO website so a categor is SEO a
categories SEO Checker a categories SEO
agency what I want to do is write a
paragraph description about each of
these categories how can I go about
doing that I would go to the playground
to build my prompt for that so I'm in
the playground right now and this prompt
right here is what I feed into open AI
when we use the text discombobulator I'm
going to feed in a line of text so the
line of text could be SEO agency all
right so here's our line of text
and then we feed in a prompt that you
create you or I create and then we run
the prompt and we get the output now the
prompt I want to tell open AI that I
want a one paragraph description about
this category now I've already done this
behind the scenes I'll show you what it
looks like so SEO agency and then here's
the prompt I created write one paragraph
about the data above use the keyword SEO
in the paragraph now I'm saying this
because my whole websites about SEO so I
want to just pepper the these different
categories with the word SEO and kind of
help the AI understand the context of
where I'm coming from like for instance
rank Checker over here it might not know
that involves SEO so I'm hinting that
hey everything involves SEO so here is
the prompt I have and you can test it
under different models but we'll test it
here looking for a reliable SEO agency
to help boost your online presence an
SEO agent so I don't really like that I
don't want looking for for I want let's
modify this
description about the data above let's
try
that no I don't want that I want
basically this one paragraph one
paragraph that could represent like one
par it's hard to do this in real time
I'm like prompting in real time write a
one
paragraph
category one
paragraph to explain the
category listed
above the category relates to the
concept of SEO all right let's try
that I like that now whenever I test
prompts I'll do it multiple times and
we'll do it under different models if
I'm if I'm always going to use GPT 3.5
turbo 0125 then I'll just maintain this
I won't test it on other ones you might
want to test it under different models
so that's
good and the reason we do this inside of
the playground is because it doesn't
bias when you do this inside of when you
try to build a prompt inside of chat gbt
it's you're biasing the prompt the
results based on everything above it but
here we're deleting our conversation and
we're simply feeding this in again and
again all right so looks like it's
succeeding very well I could test it
under gp4 turbo but I'm not going to
let's try rank Checker now let's paste
that in see if this prompt works for
rank
Checker I like
it it's it's basically explaining what
this is fantastic let's try one more SEO
for
lawyers another interesting concept here
I like it now the only thing this is a
little bit long for a WordPress category
so let's dial this down let's see if we
can say let's say 50 words or less let's
try that now sometimes a word limit
doesn't work very well under
turbo but this actually seems to be
working
up all right we'll do one more
now again we're pretending we're just
pretending that these are categories on
my
website
fantastic cool now what we can do now
that we've made our prompt right again
this is the template that I feed into
open AI when we're using the text
discombobulator I feed in this heading
this heading and up here I'm going to
put in one line at a time I'll tell you
what that means in a second and I'll
feed in your prompt so let's go create
this prompt let's go create this prompt
inside a zim writer right now so we'll
go into the bulk writer because this is
where you can create your custom prompts
we'll click custom prompt and I'll paste
this in here and I'll call this there's
a format you got to follow you can read
the directions up top you can read the
directions link right here for how to
format this kind of stuff but custom
prompt
save right so there's our prompt and now
we can finally go to the text
discombobulate
so here's the text
discombobulator now we can feed in some
lines of text so let's just do 15 for
the sake of time paste them right there
now we'll load our custom prompt CP cat
you can do multiple prompts see this
works a lot like the Ser discombobulator
but it just works on text and not it's
not going to go out and perform a Ser
scrape or something on this so uh but
there's a second prompt that you can
apply you can apply prompt stacking you
can read all about that in the the
directions up here but we're just
loading this one prompt right here and
we'll call this cat and we'll choose uh
GPT 3.5 turbo because we tested it under
that we know it works and we will create
the output so I'll close
this and let's see you see it running
right
now all right let's check our output so
here's our CSV file it created now what
you got to do let make this a little bit
bigger expand this and I never use the
help up here the search but it actually
works for rap text it works very well
actually an SEO agency is a company that
specializes in search engine
optimization SEO tools local SEO so
we're creating a category Andor we're
defining all of these words fantastic
now you might be thinking that's fine
well and dandy but I really don't want
to categorize or write category
descriptions for keywords that's
perfectly fun the text discombobulator
what it does
is it takes a line of text and processes
a custom prompt against that line of
text one line of text can be up to 5,000
characters long all right and you can
have up to 500 lines of text so the use
case here was to write paragraphs for
different categories but maybe that's
not your use case there's all kinds of
different use cases I don't have a clue
what they might be uh only you would so
feel free to share those in the Facebook
group or or in the comments down below
maybe you're even have a use case right
now the feature is here if you do need
it it's a very powerful tool just make
sure to do what I I showed you and test
your prompts out inside of the uh open
AI playground and your mileage will will
be a lot better than just trying to to
come up with a prompt and just testing
it out uh in real times if you like the
video please uh give it a thumbs up
