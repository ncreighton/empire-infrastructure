# Use AI to Make Incredible Amazon Roundup Product Reviews!

one question I get asked a lot is how can I use AI to create an amazing product Roundup review very quickly and very easily let me show you how easy it is to do that it will choose five different products from Amazon and we'll have the AI write about those right pros and cons pull in a featured image and then pull in a featured image for our entire article and then it will have a call to action below each product with the link to the product to Amazon our affiliate link and then it will have a little buying guide at the end of it and then it's going to upload all that stuff to Wordpress let me demonstrate how easy this is to do so you'll need a couple prerequisites so we need a copy of zimwriter zimrider is a really great AI rating software I created you can get a license to it in the description down below you'll also need a couple more things you can get a script you need your open AI API account and there's a when you get Zoom writer it will teach you how to do all that stuff you'll need scrape out scrape out is five bucks a month to have a proxy scraper it's very very awesome and then you'll also need your pixels API key if you want a a featured image that's automatically pulled by the AI now pixels is completely free you just go to pixels.com or whatever the site I forget what the site is and you you get an account and then they give you 25 000 images a month once you've linked up your account you put the API key right in here completely free you also have to add your WordPress website if you wanted to upload a WordPress so you can go over here click setup WordPress you can add up to 10 different WordPress websites and then switch in between them whenever you're writing your article it's really easy so here is the SEO writer here's what we're going to be in today to write this Roundup review I'm going to put our title in here best cordless drills now this doesn't have to be the actual H1 or the actual meta title that you're going to use this is just the non-complicated title we're giving to the AI to help it understand the context of what we're writing about so it's best cordless drills usually that's going to be your keyword you'll do two different H2S and the first H2 will just be our title and the second will be factors to consider when buying a cordless drill now I want to review five different products and I want five different factors now I can fill these factors out manually if I want to or we can press this plus S button and the AI will automatically generate these there the plus s appears anytime you have an H3 or an H4 and it will come up with these different subheadings for you all automatically and you can go in here and edit it you can say oh you know what I don't want five I want six and then you can regenerate it if you really want to now we need to get our products in here so we're going to click these two boxes here the first is the enable subheading box all right but the problem is it's hard to see where we are so I like to enable color outlines to make it a little bit easier so here are the five different h3s where we're going to put our products now I have five different product pages from Amazon here and we'll just go down the list I'll take the first URL make sure I've copied it first URL I'll paste that into H3 number one box I'll paste it right here for the URL for scraping I'm going to click the trigger product layout button and then I'll copy the title I'll put it right there not the whole thing just something short then I'll go to the next product and I'll put it in here and I will copy the title scroll down next product put it in here copy the title you see how it works right go down here copy the title that's four one two three I'm on four for some did I miss one I missed I skipped one no big deal doesn't matter what order we're putting these in and copy the title cool all right now we have all of the products we're gonna write about and the links to them for the AI to scrape we have our different factors in right here now we just have to configure some different options so I want to write in uh first person plural the we us are literally devices I want that I want lists I want tables I want a short FAQ I want key takeaways I want to use the image API this is the pixels connection that we have now to generate that featured image for us sometimes it's Hit or Miss okay but it's better than nothing at least to start with and what else can we do we want to connect our WordPress website so we'll check this website here and you can choose a subcategory a category of subcategory and then we're going to set this as a draft just because we're demonstrating this now normally you could have the AI connect to YouTube all right using spray pal and then pull in some YouTube videos that would be relevant to your article I like to do that in the bulk writer I like to use this option in the bulk writer but for here I want my YouTube videos placed in specific places so I'm actually going to go up here to the first H2 the best cordless drills and I'm going to put in curly brackets and then the letters YT and that's a special command to find a YouTube video to put in that first H2 I like the YouTube videos because the AI will find try to find something that's relevant and that will help boost the page on time which Google likes somebody's pogo sticking from your website that's a good indication you don't have high quality content so if you can get people to stick around for a little bit and actually enter the search intent which a YouTube video can do then that's a win for everybody want to select Outlaw personality and now Outlaw I like to choose that one for hardware tools and things like that because you think people are outside building stuff and whatnot so they might be like that that rough and tough personality I am stereotyping here so forgive me my wife is a little petite girl and she likes to uh build stuff too so I don't call it I wouldn't classify her as an outlaw she's an outlier I think all right and normally I would add manual keywords to insert automatically I'd pull these from like phrase or Surfer or neuron writer or something and that would help us boost our SEO score I'm not going to do that for this particular video so we have everything in here we can double check if we want but if we're ready to go we can just click Start SEO writer with scraping now what's going to happen is this is going to scrape those five different websites or five different web pages from Amazon pull that data and compile it all and then write that article and then what you'll see is here's the WordPress say we're uploading it to again this is a site about singing so it has nothing to do with Hardware or drills or whatnot but I just use this for the test website and we're going to upload it right here so I'm going to shut up now we're going to watch this thing work I'll Speed the video up and then we'll check out the results all right the article's done it should also appear in your output folder wherever you've stored it so this is our this is the article right here we can bring it up if we really want to it's in markdown format and you can convert this to uh non-markdown by pasting it either into WordPress via Gutenberg or by a markdown converter but as you can see this article cost us eight pennies to write now normally it would take me hours to write a product Roundup review this took a few minutes and this was eight pennies to write and then we have all of our different images this is gonna be the featured image that was pulled from pixels and then here are the different product images pulled from Amazon now these images will be uploaded to Amazon if you don't like that like maybe you don't you don't have licenses or stuff like that or you're worried about copyright issues you can disable that and what will happen is you can just fill the images in manually maybe you have your own photos of the products or maybe you're embedding the images or maybe you're using the Amazon API you can do all that on your end if you really want to otherwise they're automatically uploaded so let's refresh and check our article out so there it is put this in the center here so I can easy see it easier so here's our image now again you're for some articles it's going to be hit or miss this is the pixels featured image that was automatically pulled you can replace this obviously if you want to here's our title now we can always change this up if we want to also but this will be the slug in the featured image or in the in the article we publish it so there is our first HQ the key takeaways our second H2 the best cordless drills our third H2 the factors to consider and then finally our frequently asked questions so here's our key takeaways best cordless drills how to choose and use a cordless drill that's awesome so someone that was looking for the best quarter cordless drills would

that now as we scroll down we see all of the five different products that the AI wrote about we have a little call to action for each one and then finally we get down to our buying guide now we can we
