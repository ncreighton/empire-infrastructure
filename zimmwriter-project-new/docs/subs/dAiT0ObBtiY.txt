# Lesson 10 - Getting Started with AI Images

hey in this lesson we're going to talk all about generating AI image prompts inside of Zim writer to manually generate images and also automatically generating images into your articles inside a zim writer it's really cool let me show you how it works so let's talk prompts first using the prompts that Zim writer generates to create your AI images is a manual approach maybe you have some articles that you want to manually generate those images you want to go slow and methodically this allows you to do that so this is our text file of our this is benefits of eating fruit on digestion so at the top of it above the title we have this mid Journey AI image prompt so it create a photorealistic image of a vibrant bowl of mixed fruit such as berries kiwis and pineapple displayed on a clean white background awesome so we can take this prompt and feed it into any AI image generator we want but this is built specifically for Mid Journey because it has this stuff at the beginning and stuff at the end which mid Journey it's like special codes for Mid journey to to use version six of mid journey to use the aspect ratio of 16 by9 so we can just take this and paste it into mid Journey here's an example of generating the image using mid Journey Unfortunately they don't have a public API so there's no way for Zim riter to automate this process without risking getting your account banned so here's an example of an image that we generated very high quality but it's a cumbersome process because you create an account on Mid Journey then you have to go and use it on Discord eventually it seems like they're adding the ability to generate the AI images inside of mid Journey's website itself because Discord is just so cumbersome once you get the hang of it it's not that bad so here's some examples of some different images very high quality stuff but again it's more of a manual process right now the other place that you can generate these AI image prompts is in the subheadings so in the bulk writer that Penny Arcade SEO writer there's this check box right here to enable mid Journey prompt for each H2 and then what will happen is for each H2 to I didn't do it for this article but you would get something similar to this but relevant to your subheading underneath each subheading so you can then go and create your subheading images also if you want to but now what if you want to automate the entire thing what if you said you know what I don't care about the prompts I just want to automate everything yeah you can do that too so there is this dropdown for a featured image and for subheading image selections and then also your subheading image model let's talk about pexels first if you check pixels then you need a pexels API account pixels is not AI images pixels is like basically stock photos but the cool thing is it's completely free so you can go to pixels you can make an account and if you navigate around you can find the API and get API access 100% for for free there's no cost for this whatsoever the only downside is that the the widescreen images selection is very limited and that's one of the reasons you won't see pixels as a drop down for the subheadings just because we struggle enough to find something that's relevant for the featured image so it's even harder to find something that's relevant for the subheading images so we only have that as an option for the featured image now moving down the list we have some Dolly 3 models that you can choose now Dolly 3 is by open AI so the cool thing about Dolly 3 if you choose that for your your automated image is you don't have to add another API account it just uses your existing open AI account account to generate the images now the downside is though it's a lot more expensive so generating one dolly3 image standard definition which still is is high quality very high quality is 8 pennies generating an a highdefinition one is 12 pennies so it's very expensive to use these models compared to stable diffusion which is down below so anything that says SD is stable diffusion you can choose Dolly 3 or stable diffusion for both the subheadings and the featured images now let me talk about stable diffusion for a moment you you get a stable diffusion account by going to stability. and then clicking on like the API platform and then you make an account and you'll get an API key but then you got to put some credits into your account now the cool thing is $10 in credits will get you about 4,000 images so your credits go very far instability. a so I highly recommend just signing up putting 10 bucks in and you'll probably never have to worry about image paying for images for the foreseeable future and you'll also notice in the drop down there's lots of different options now they all cost the same thing 3 cents for this no style three cents for this 3D model three cents for this analog film all these different options which one should you choose what you can do is you can take the prompt because I didn't I don't tell people this but I'm telling you this right now this mid Journey AI image prompt this portion right here is what I take and feed into to all of the different AI models so I feed it into Dolly 3 I also feed it into stable diffusion so what we can do is we can take this prompt and we can go over here to this site called dream studio. a and it uses your stability AI account so it shows me my credits up here it uses my account uses my login uses my credits it's made by the same company dream Studio by stability Ai and what's great about this site is it allows us to put our p in and then select some different styles and see what they look like ahead of time now you want to come down here and select 16 by9 because that's what Zim writer uses in select one image and you'll see the cost for each generation is .23 credit so very inexpensive but you can test these different styles out you can say oh you know what this particular style works very well for whatever website or job that I'm doing in the bulk writer or the SC writer or Penny Arcade right now so I'll I'll do origami or something like that very high quality images there's origami this is I think neon or something the neon Punk style so you can play around with the stuff in this dream studio and then find something that fits your your particular tastes couple more just like housekeeping items with this if you select WordPress to automatically upload this stuff it will upload those images into your article but it will also let's see if I can find it will also download the images to your output folder here's this is the funny one do monkeys poop in other fun facts so this is our featured image right here this it doesn't have any number it's titled just the same as the article itself and then we have our different I I chose subheading images AI images for each H2 so these are our different subheading images you know so you have these as a backup or if you want to like manually upload these things or maybe you're not using Wordpress and so you can't do an automated upload you can still manually upload your stuff using the the using the files inside of this folder all right woo that that was a beginner lesson but it felt Advanced there's still some stuff I didn't show you so tune in for when I get the advanced uh lesson ready there'll be more secrets and tips I share with you in there if you like this video please give it a thumbs up subscribe drop drop a comment down below if you have a question join the Facebook group and I will see
