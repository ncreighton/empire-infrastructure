# 3 Ways to Get ZimmWriter on Mac Right Now!

hey this video is going to be a love letter to all the Mac users out there that want to get zenwriter running on their Mac no before you go absolutely Bonkers I am not yet releasing a native Mac version we're not doing that in this video I really wish I could I'm still still learning the language we're still developing it but in this video I'm going to show you three very easy ways to get Zoom Rider running on a Mac laptop or a Mac desktop computer very simple a lot of people that want to generate content right now with the generator and have a Mac are just running out to Best Buy and buying a 200 laptop because the the platform a Mac should not stop you from generating a return on your investment if you can generate a thousand blog posts with a zim writer if you can write SEO optimized blog posts with zimrider if you can write up to 625 files for a local business in their services that they offer and earn thousands of dollars with that why are you letting the platform stand in your way that's a foolish decision in my mind don't let the platform don't let the platform hold you back from growing your business so I've said my piece let me dive in and show you the three different ways I've set them all up they're actually really easy and there's pros and cons for each so I'll explain each of these in this video the first way is called parallels parallels has been around for ages and what it's allowed people to do is run a Windows application on their Mac it essentially is a full-blown operating system it's going to run the entire version of Windows 11 or Windows 10 or whatnot on your Mac I have a M2 but this will work on M1 I believe it also works on Intel Max also it's again it's been around for years the let's talk price first of all you need a license for it and it's a hundred dollars a year that could be a lot of money but if you're in this business if you're generating a thousand blog posts and you're earning five thousand or ten thousand dollars a month this is a drop in the bucket this is 10 bucks a month so you get the license and you'll also need to get a Windows 11 license key you can get those for 20 bucks online I think I bought mine for twenty dollars here's a Windows 11 key are these legit keys I don't know I've never had a problem I always buy keys this way never had a single issue so you get a key for 10 bucks and then you set it up and you download the application you set it up and this is what it looks like Windows 11. now I have zoom Rider right here I'm running the the alternative version with the exe just double click it and it opens right up and Magic commands work let's actually go to notepad and let's run a magic command I'll show you so what's the best flavor of ice cream I like vanilla bean that's a what's one of my favorite oh I changed the triggers here a little wrong with it Ctrl shift one but the triggers work magic commands work writing the blog post work everything works because this is a genuine copy of windows it's running your Mac is now running Windows so it works perfect it works absolutely perfect and what's really nice let's talk Pros right now it's incredibly fast this is just Lightning Fast there's no lag it's not downloading stuff from the internet very fast and that the benefit is I can drag and drop files from my Mac over to this Windows instance no problem at all it's so quick the other benefit is this will run stuff other than just zimrider like there are a lot of good applications on Windows out there that are not available on Mac you can run essentially anything I think you can even game with this too although if you're going to go play like a really high fidelity game like The Witcher or something like that your mileage is definitely going to vary but for a lot of games you can install Steam on here I believe and play lots of games lots of benefits to this model some of the downsides this is comparably priced to the other two two solutions I'm about to show you except for you do need to get that copy of Windows that license for Windows the other kind of downside to it is it's going to use a little bit more resources on your Mac a little bit more battery power if you go up here to your your battery you're going to see it's using quote significant energy I don't know how how many hours you're going to get on this if you're on battery power you might get might reduce You by 30 percent I'm not really sure it is also going to use a little bit more RAM this is going to take up about 8 to 10 gigs of RAM to run this Windows instance so just keep those things in mind those might be deciding factors for you or they might not I don't know the first way of getting Zoom Rider working let me go over here and shut down parallels now and I'll show you the next way so the next way is actually let's open that up is called crossover by a company called code Weavers now what crossover is and I hope I'm explaining this correctly there is a free emulation to run Windows stuff on Mac and it's called wine w-i-n-e but it's it gets technical there's a lot of steps and whatnot crossover is like a pretty shell that goes over that complex thing it makes it very easy for people like you and me to just start start running those windows applications without jumping through a lot of Hoops now this is less expensive than getting parallels this is 74 a year or you can pay this one-time fee for 500 bucks that's a lot of money and then never pay again I think the yearly fee is just that makes a lot of sense in my opinion so you'll download the application and it's kind of it's different that's the best way to explain it this is what you do so you'll click install and you'll install an unlisted application you know click install again and you'll call you make a bottle I don't know why they call it a bottle but we'll call this zimwriter and we'll click done and then we pick the exe file so I've downloaded zimwriter I've unzipped it this is the alternative version it's on my desktop in this zimrider underscore a directory and I select the exe file and it's going to create this bottle it takes a minute and then it just runs the application but we're going to exit out of this really quick because I want this to finish and then it's going to say no applications are found in this bottle and I haven't really used this a lot so my expertise is very limited with this but what I do know is you'll click this run command up here and you'll find that exe file again so I'll go to my desktop go to the zimwriter A I'll find the exe and then what you'll do is I click this one time save command as a launcher click it one time and just wait a moment and you'll see in the background a little icon will appear so there it is zimrider so all I have to do now to run zimrider is I simply open actually you know what I think it even puts it inside of the launcher let's see if it does that yeah there it is so it actually makes an application now so I can just double click on this and it will start the Sim writer up for us there we are the zimwriter 707 now it's all tied to this directory so I I don't really know how it all works but probably don't move the directory but zimwriter is now running all of the functions work in here has normal you can go into the options menu and set the directory the output directory and all this stuff the only thing that's going to be different is these magic command triggers now normally I'll have my magic commands as control like control one and whatnot but to get it working right with crossover on a Mac you'd want to select something like Ctrl shift and let me open up notepad and demonstrate something so we don't have to do this with parallels parallels everything just works perfect it's just like you're running Windows everything's perfect crossover a little bit different so what is the best flavor of ice cream so I'm going to put something I'm going to put the letter d and I'm going to copy it and put it in my clipboard right now because I don't want to buy it I forget what's in my clipboard so only the letter D is in the in my clipboard right now so I'm going to highlight this text you'll understand why I did that in a second highlight this text and I'm going to hit Ctrl shift one that's for the magic command now Zoom writer is going to say your input is too short for the magic command the reason it says that is because zimwriter can't copy and it can't paste it can't do those things using crossover just because this is Macs are very secure and it can't just directly access the clipboard or the screen like that so what we have to do is we highlight the text and we hit command C to copy it now that text is inside of the clipboard so if I went over here and hit Ctrl V or command V you can see it's in the clipboard right there so it's in the clipboard now I'm going to hit my magic command key Ctrl shift one and Zim matter now sees that clipboard it can access it it's going to carry out the magic command but what's going to happen is it's not going to paste the result because it can't all it can do is store that result in the clipboard now so I've hit command V again Watch what's going to happen there's our answer there's the magic command output so it's a little bit different to use it this way but you can get it working so that's crossover comparing it to parallels it does not use nearly as much energy nearly as much memory it's a very efficient way to run zimriter on a Mac what else magic bands don't work as well they work flawlessly inside of parallels they don't work as as nicely so to speak in crossover the light from a licensing standpoint crossover is a little bit less expensive than going the parallels route in my opinion if you don't care about using magic commands at all then I would probably choose crossover compared to parallels one of the downsides is though at the end of the month when I release an update you're going to have to go into the crossover over here and then delete this bottle and then re go through those steps again whereas inside of parallels you can just delete the folder or just upgrade to the normal means of just taking that a3x file and copying it over so a little bit less steps or Hoops to jump through using parallels to upgrade then crossover now let me show you the third way I just set this up today and this is actually really exciting I was like wow this is really freaking cool so the Third Way is called a Windows VPS so down here you'll see this thing called cloud and I'll open it up and this is an instance of Windows 11 running in the cloud right now so watch this I'll go over here and I've got a notepad I put notepad on here all right and we'll oops I'll move this over here and I'll start the Zim writer up let's do that startup Zim writer okay so here's Zim writer and then we'll have the same command what is the best flavor of ice cream and we'll highlight it and I'll hit Ctrl 1. so again this is a copy of Windows 11 but it's in the cloud I'm accessing this through a remote desktop session the server for this I'm in the states so the servers in San Francisco although it's kind of weird though I selected I'm in the Central Central States I'm in Ohio but for some reason they gave me a server in San Francisco I the company that I'm getting this server through is called cantabo c-o-n uh let's see con cantabo and I initially set this up with this this is a German company so I set the server up and Germany too much lag so I moved the server to the US and it works a lot better I can still notice a lag so this is just like parallels in that it's a full-blown copy of Windows I think this is Windows Server 2022 it runs just like Windows 11. you can't tell any difference uh full-blown copy of Windows it will kind of do whatever you want but there's going to be a little bit of a lad because I'm not running it on my Mac I'm running it from the cloud okay so you do not need that more powerful internet connection for all of these Solutions you will need an internet connection because zimrider needs open AI that openai connection so you're you're going to have to have that internet connection but this Cloud version will require more a more powerful internet than those other options the parallels option and also the the crossover option but everything works all right zenwriter works right here now what's really cool let's talk some more Pros about this we'll talk some cons too you go to cantabo and there's other places to get a Windows VPS but contabo is very reliable very secure I feel safe setting up my Dropbox on there and stuff like that so you'll go to more products you'll select windows and here's the pricing so I just got the basic Cloud VPS server 15 bucks a month so it's a little bit more pricey about 150 a year or maybe I guess 170 a year but there's a big benefit to this all right now zimrider is cloud-based I can access zimrider now anywhere I can access it from my own Windows computer I can access it from my MacBook I can access it from my iPad anywhere that has a remote desktop connection and there's a so you this is Microsoft Remote Desktop you just download this in the App Store anywhere any application even your phone you can download remote desktop you can literally run Zoom rider in the cloud right now you can set up a queue of a thousand blog posts to generate and you go to the movies with your family and during a really boring scene in the movie you can log in with your phone and make sure that there's no errors and that Zoom writer is actually generating and whatnot so this is a really interesting option to make zimrider essentially cloud based little a little bit more expensive than the other Solutions it is going to require that higher bandwidth connection but it's a very interesting solution I've went in here and set up Chrome with all my bookmarks and everything and I'm like well this is really cool now unlike parallels you're not going to game with this you're not going to do any gaming but this is a very interesting way to to run Windows applications anywhere including on your MacBook so those are the three options what would I choose to be honest I'm using parallels right now but I'm really leaning towards this this VPS solution simply because it uses less resources I have a lot of RAM on my MacBook but when I'm mobile like if I go to a coffee shop or something I don't want parallels to be sucking my battery okay and this is a better alternative to run zimrider more efficiently if I want those magic commands and things like that otherwise I might just stick to crossover so there's a lot of options I'd love to hear what choice you pick drop a comment down below tell me what you decided to go with or at least decided to try out I know that parallels I think they have a free trial but you do need that Windows license crossover has a free trial you don't need a Windows license for that I don't think this does but this is a month-to-month contract right so drop a comment down below I'm really interested to see if you are deciding to jump in and get Zim writer and start generating a lot of content a lot of amazing content on your Mac tell me what you're using tell me how it's working out I'd love to hear from you there's links down below there's a link to zoom writer if you don't have it you can get it there's also a link to the Facebook group definitely join there's about 7 000 Zim writers in that group right now is growing at a record Pace we're all talking AI we're talking how to generate uh tons of content and outrank our competitors I'd love to see you there so hey good luck with your content generation I'll talk to you later
