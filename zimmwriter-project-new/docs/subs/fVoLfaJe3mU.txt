# Lesson 7 - How to Use the Topical Authority Generator

hey and welcome to your getting started guide with the topical Authority generator inside of Zim Rider now you can find it in the AI Vault and then by pressing the activate topical Authority generator button but I'm going to close the interface because I want to take a step back and talk about topical Authority in general it's very important to understand this concept the best way to understand it is to give you this example imagine there's two sites and a user is searching for an article about how to wash a dog and Google is trying to choose between these two sites these two sites are completely identical in terms of backlinks and everything else domain creation date the only thing that's different is the content on the sites both of the sites have an article about how to watch a dog but the first site is only about dogs dog care dog food how to wash a dog how to care for a dog how to adopt a dog dog breeds all that stuff the other site is about everything it only has one dog article how to wash a dog but it has an article on cats an article on trampolines an article on investing in an article on buying your first house an article on paintball you get the point which result do you think Google would return to the user the result from the site that's all about dogs or the result from the site that's about everything probably the result that's all about dogs because that site is more of an authority at least in Google's eyes on the topic of dogs in a nutshell that is topical Authority you can use the topical Authority files that Zim riter generates to help give you ideas on how to structure the categories on your site to structure what articles to write about to structure the different silos you want to create it will even give you some blog post ideas but there's a caveat to all of this you want to use your brain this is not just plug and chug creating your topical Authority map in the different articles you want to write about is so foundational and so important and if you have a shaky or a poor Foundation your whole house is going to fall down so it's very important to get this right you use what Zim writer gives you as a very fast track method to build that topical Authority but it doesn't do everything for you you have to use your brain power you have to use your intelligence so let's look at the the menu and there's a couple options in here it's not very complicated and if you ever get stuck definitely click this directions link this directions link will take you to my exhaustive guide on topical Authority generation there's a lot of good meat in here if you have any questions but the first thing it asks you for is a broad concept so we can put a broad Concept in now again this could be your Niche or maybe you're just investigating you're trying to find a particular Niche it's all possible with the topical Authority generator I have some examples over here where I said okay starting a blog so my Niche would be how to teach others to start a blog so I could put starting a blog in and then you can tell Zim writer how many clusters about starting a blog do you want it to create how many longtail s for each underline each cluster do you want zoom writer to create and then how many blog post titles for each underline that word each again longtail do you want so theoretically you can say I want 10 clusters and then for each cluster I want 10 longtails and then for each longtail I want 10 blog post titles that will give you an Excel CSV with a thousand blog post titles with I think what is it a 100 clusters 100 long Tales and 10 clusters 10 yeah I think that I think the math works out right there now you can also say you know what I want 30 clusters and I want 30 longtails for each cluster then you can't select 10 anymore because by selecting one you're already at that that 900 limit right there so you can play with this configure it however you want and then you can choose the model that you want as it generates so here's an example of the output that you can get so this is the starting of blog so here's our broad concept I believe for this one I chose 20 topical clusters 20 long tales and then two blog post titles so we have choosing a niche that's a cluster it gave us content creation blog platform selection do main name and hosting it gave us a longtail keyword for each of these clusters how to choose a profitable Niche for blogging finding the right Niche for my blog selecting a niche for my blog Niche selection there might be some overlap and again this is where you use your brain you might say oh you know all of these are related right here I can lump them all into this particular one and you can highlighted or whatever you want to do and then for each of these we got some different blog post titles now again there might be some overlap with this and again some of these might not be ideal for writing a blog post about or whatnot you'll have to use your brain but it's a great starting point so 15 essential tips for choosing your blog Niche we come down here to uh Niche Trends 12 hot blogging industry Niche Trends you need let's see sustainability choosing a sustainable blog niche for long-term success that's pretty cool let's see what else do we have three best strategies for creating sharable blog this is a gold mine of possible topics to write about now I have no idea what the search volume is this is all AI generated but you need to understand the AI was trained on actual human written content so the Clusters you're getting the long Tales you're getting the blog post titles you're getting actually makes sense people are probably searching them even if the search tools HRS or rush or whatever it is show zero search volume or don't even have the title in there this is a gold mine for getting clicks now you have a couple other columns over here we have a category column an outline Focus column and a merged column which has the title plus the category plus the outline Focus so how do we take this stuff and put it into Zim writer so at the very basic level we can take just a title or a bunch of different titles if we want to copy them go to the bulk writer paste it in and then write an article about this particular topic or what we can do is we can go to the merged column now again the merged column has the title of the article the category and the outline Focus the outline Focus I don't want to get too deep here it helps give direction to the AI about what it's writing about when it creates the outline the outline for the bulk writer in general is going to be AI generated so the outline Focus will help give it direction as it creates that outline and the category will create the category in WordPress if you are aut uploading this to Wordpress so we can take this and we can go back to the bulk writer and we can paste this in and now it has the category in there in the outline Focus so the outline will theoretically be a little bit better than not having the outline focus in there and this will Auto um create this category on WordPress if you are using uh WordPress so this was starting a blog maybe you're like you know what this is just there's too much here I want to dial it in a little bit more I want to talk about something a little bit more Niche specific so let's close this and one of those results in there was starting a real estate blog so let me open this up so I redid the topical Authority generator but about the concept the broad concept of starting a real estate blog so again I would be I would create a website and that website would teach other people other real estate agents or whatnot how to create a real estate blog so here's the different clusters it gave us choosing a niche because I guess there's different types of niches for real estate blogs content creation blogging platforms search engine optimization now we look in here and see exploring Niche options for Real Estate blogging discovering untapped real estate blog niches top rated platforms for Real Estate blogging designing effective real estate marketing materials and then we have some different blog post titles for this you're like you know what I want to go a little bit deeper I want to Niche down even more now we have real estate blog marketing strategies take this format this a little a little bit so we have now again the broad concept of real estate marketing strategy we have content creation real estate blog ideas that's the longtail Why Real Estate blogging is essential for marketing 11 tips to convert real estate blog visitors see lead generation effective lead magnets for real estate blog marketing property listings income generating rental listings what are the best income generating rental property listings like I guess the formats that you would use cool that shows you how easy it is to to keep niching down and find that perfect topic that you want to cover and it doesn't have to be realize this real estate blog marketing strategies doesn't have to be the entirety of your website maybe you just want to exhaustively cover a particular topic but you want to flesh it out a little bit more yeah you can just put that in here and flesh it out a little more and then you can create that as a silo on your site I have one more example to show you this example was for gardening and for this example in Zim writer I chose zero blog post titles so I think I chose 20 20 clusters 20 longtails by doing this it's a lot less expensive because and I forgot to mention this if you use gp4 this can get expensive if you're doing like 800 results this can be five bucks but if you're using like GPT 3.5 turbo or something like that this is a lot less expensive but maybe 50 cents or something like that but if you specify zero block post titles it's very inexpensive so up here I think I chose GPT 3.5 turbo this cost me six pennies and I have what I get 500 results out so I chose zero blog post titles for this I said just give me the broad Concepts give me the topical clusters give me the longtail keywords because I'm just investigating where I want to go like I want to talk about gardening but I'm really not sure where do I want to talk about soil preparation here's some different concepts I could talk about no I really don't like these I don't want to talk about that watering techniques I could have a whole site about how to water your garden so we could go down that rabbit hole if we want we could take this and feed it back into the topical Authority generator as our broad concept composting Pest Control you know what that's actually not a bad Niche I don't know how competitive it is but everybody that plants a garden has to deal with bugs so that would be a great Niche from a a Content standpoint and you can advertise affiliate products that's a pretty cool Niche so I could take this control and go back to the topical Authority generator paste it in here and say give me 20 clusters 20 long tales two blog post titles and see what happens so you see how that works really awesome way a novel way to come up with great stuff to talk about for
