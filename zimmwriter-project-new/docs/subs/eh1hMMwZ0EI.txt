# Lesson 22 - How to Run ZimmWriter on Mac (M-Series + macOS 14+)

I'm going to share with you in this
video how to get Zim Rider up and
running on your your Mac and actually
you can use this to to get almost any
Windows uh Windows application running
on a Mac so it is uh it's not just
limited to Zim riter but we're going to
use it just for Zim riter in this video
it's actually really easy to do and it's
completely free also one of the one of
the ways people will use zom Rider on a
Mac is using something called parallels
which runs an entire Windows operating
system on your Mac but it is more
resource intensive it uses battery and
it's not as not as fast to get up and
running with it so what I'm going to
show you is very battery efficient very
quick and it's pretty cool the only
difference is Magic commands won't work
the same way that they work on a Windows
PC so if you want the entire
functionality of Zim Rider then you'd
have to use something like parallels or
a Windows PC otherwise you know if
you're just looking for the bulk writer
the SEO writer the penny arcade and the
other um non keyboard you know magic
commands for writer then this would work
perfectly for you so first things first
what you want to do is go to my web page
ranking tactics.com and click on secret
training and you'll scroll down and
you'll want to download Zer now don't
click this button this button right here
is to download it for people on a
Windows computer if you're running on a
Mac then you want to click on this link
right here to download the alternate
version okay so download this version
right here it will be a zip file and
that will get you the alternate version
the next thing you want to do is go to
this website get whiskey. a so g t whh i
k
Y.A just a little
background the program that we're going
to use to run Zoom right on a Mac is
called wine okay and wine is a it's more
technical it's cumbersome to to install
you have to get to the terminal the
command line if you're not good with
technology even for me it's a little bit
cumbersome to use so this is something
that makes doing all that very simple so
you'll download the latest version so
get whiskey. download the latest version
that's all we need right now from our
browser okay actually I didn't click the
download button it's download latest
there we go okay so there's whiskey so
we'll double click it to unzip it in the
whiskey app now before I run it I'm
actually going to move this to my
applications
folder okay so drag it and put it in my
applications folder because I want it to
appear in my Launchpad there we go want
it to be inside of here okay says
whiskey is downloaded from the internet
are you sure you want to open it yes now
you might not see this screen when you
first start up whiskey it will actually
ask you to download like this missing
file that requires like GH TK or G GT KP
I don't know what it is but there's some
400 megabyte file it's going to ask you
to download you'll just follow the
prompts and download that it might take
a minute or two but then when you
finally download it you'll come to this
screen right here okay now the first
thing we want to do is create a bottle
the bottle is like a container that's
going to hold any programs that we want
to install so we'll create a bottle and
I'm going to call this bottle zom writer
you can call the bottle whatever you
want because you can have multiple
bottles but we'll call this Zim
writer and you don't need to configure
any other settings this is all fine
we'll click create now it's not going to
allow you to do anything right now it's
thinking right now and if you have a
slower Mac this might take longer I'm on
an M1 Pro but if you have a faster Mac
this might go quicker we'll wait for
this little spinny thing to finish all
right now there's a c drive that we can
access but before we do anything we want
to go back to our Mac folder and get our
Zim writer okay this is the Zim writer
zip file that we downloaded okay and
double click to unzip it there it is now
what we want to do is go back to Whiskey
okay and open our C drive okay see this
little link we'll click
it so on this side we have our C drive
for Windows that's where stuff stored
and on this side we have our Mac
downloads folder okay so in our C drive
we'll click on
users and you'll see this thing called
crossover we'll click on that and we'll
look for the downloads
folder then what you want to do is take
the Zim writer alternative version okay
and drag it over to that C drive
downloads folder okay see how easy that
was now what we're going to do is we're
going to go in here back to the whiskey
menu we'll click pin program because in
this bottle any programs that we want to
install we're going to pin those uh ex
executable files okay so we can easy
like more easily access them as opposed
to like having to hunt them down inside
of here and stuff okay so we'll click
pin program and we're going to pin Zim
writer so we'll put in Zim
writer we'll find where it's installed
remember it's in the users folder
crossover folder your downloads folder
and there's Zim riter so we'll open it
up we're going to pin this exe so we
just double click on it okay we click
pin now you won't see it at first
because you have to click the refresh
button there it is now check this out
all we have to do to run Zoom writer
okay is double click it now it might
take a second to to start
up and there it is now we'll have to go
through the the setup so if you're doing
this for the first time you'll have to
enter your API key from open AI okay and
then you'll have to enter your Zim
writer email and your Zim writer license
key okay I'm not going to do that on
camera what I'm actually going to do is
I store all of the Zim writer data for
like your license and whatnot and
something called a settings.ini file so
if you have an older version of Zim
riter or you're migrating over from a PC
version you can find your settings inii
file in the zoom writer directory okay
and then you can open up
I'll do this from scratch to show you
you go into your C drive in here you'll
go into users crossover downloads
alternative version we actually take our
settings ini
I and copy it into here make sure Zoom
writer is not doing not not running when
you do that okay again and again I don't
want you guys to get confused what I
just did is only for people that have a
previous install of Zim riter that for
whatever reason are setting this up
freshh and don't want to have to go
through the whole enter your open AI key
and zom writer license key and all that
stuff okay so now I can close all these
windows don't need them anymore and I
can run Zim writer again but before I do
that I want to close whiskey to show you
how You' start Zim rer fresh so we can
go over here to lunch
pad okay and we can open up whiskey and
remember it's in here now because we
moved whiskey to our applications folder
double click on that and we go on the
zoom riter bottle in case you have
multiple BT models and we open up Zim
riter so we're already set up now so Zim
riter you can minimize this and you can
run it as normal okay but all right one
problem you're going to run into is
where your output files are going to be
stored okay so right now the output
files let me show you are going to be
stored on that like C drive which is
hard to find and hard to access it would
be much better in my opinion to have
your output flat folders let's see here
stored inside of your Mac downloads
folder so in the Mac downloads folder
let's make an output directory for Zoom
writer let's make a folder called Zim
writer output and then what we're got to
do is we got to find that inside of here
so let's go set directory to save blogs
now what you want to look for is this
forward slash because this like my
computer and whatnot this is your
Windows computer okay we don't want that
we want the folder from your Mac okay so
look for this little forward slash and
then we'll scroll down to users and
you'll find your Mac
User and you'll find your downloads
folder you'll find the directory we just
created called zom writer output and
we'll set that as our directory now and
we'll save the
options I'll show you let's write
something really quick how to wash a dog
and we'll make it one H2 disable
conclusions and we'll start the writer
okay and I'll go to that folder I'll
show you how the output now will go to
into that folder on your Mac hard drive
otherwise like I said it would be in
like your C drive which you can't really
access inside of here you can only
access inside of the whiskey app and
then by clicking this button so it's
cumbersome you don't want to do that
you'd rather probably have your output
in the Mac uh downloads folder cool
there it is so we have our little popup
saying it's done and there's our our
file right there inside of our Mac
downloads folder now the last thing I
want to show you before I let you guys
go off to the races is how to update
okay so whenever I release a new update
you don't have to you should not have to
redo all those steps again all you
should have to do is click this update
button it will tell you when update's
available and you'll click the update
button you might have to wait a second
because it will download Z the the
update in the background you just click
it once you'll wait a second and then if
there's an update available you'll see
this appear and you'll click yes and
zoom writer will close count to five in
your head so it updates in the
background and then when you double
click to reopen it you should be on the
new version I was on version 10 and now
we are in version
10.1 that is the latest version of Zoom
writer again everything should work and
all the outputs should go to that output
folder that we created your magic
commands won't work as expected they're
they're going to work differently inside
of here so using magic commands with
with whiskey or whatnot is not really
recommended if you want your magic
commands to work I'd either recommend
using parallels or get a Windows PC
other than that I hope this helped you
get up and running with Zim writer on a
Mac if you have any questions you can
reach me in the Facebook group otherwise
good luck with your content generation
and I'll talk to you guys later
