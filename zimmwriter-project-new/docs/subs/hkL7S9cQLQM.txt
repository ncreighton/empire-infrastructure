# Lesson 21 - How to Mimic Any Writing Style

one of the most common questions I get
is how can I have the AI write less like
an AI and more like me more like my
style we all have different writing
styles and I'm not talking about AI
words there's already a feature inside
of Zim writer to Nuke AI words your
delve your dive and things like that so
I'm not talking about AI words I'm just
talking about the style of the writing
the humor that's involved all right the
sentence structure the vocabulary that
the word choices is it a 10th grade word
level or is it an eighth grade word
level all of these factors affect the
writing style but it's hard especially
if you have multiple websites with
multiple Styles it's hard to to dial
that in with an AI as it writes but now
you can with the style mimic inside a
zim writer you can create up to a
thousand different styles for all your
different blogs all your different
clients or whatever and then select them
whenever you want to write in that
particular style let me show you how it
works so we'll open up Zim writer and
the style mimic feature is in the bulk
writer the SEO writer the penny arcade
if you don't know what the penny arcade
is you can put in up to a thousand URLs
and summarize those so that's called the
penny arcade and then product roundups
if you're doing like a top 10 products
or whatever the style mimics in there
too but we're going to look at the bulk
writer right now and you'll see this
button called style mimic open it up and
the first thing I want you to do is
click on this directions link and it
will bring up the style mimic directions
page that has more information that I'm
not going to cover in this video in it
it's definitely a worth your time
reading you'll see in the mimic menu a
style to mimic box where you can feed in
up to 40,000 characters that you want
the AI to mimic and you can and this can
be anything you want this can be a text
document this can be a Word document a
web page your web page a competitor's
web page whatever you want again we're
we're mimicking the writing style of
this so I have this blog post I wrote
here and I'm going to just take the
content from here and put it right
inside here now it's not that long
there's other blog posts I wrote that
are longer again the longer the better
but we'll run with this now the model
you choose down here is the model that
it's going to use to generate the mimic
so in a way you might want to use a
higher end model like GPT 4 Turbo or GPT
4 as opposed to GPT 3.5 so we'll check
uh GPT for Turbo and then you press
generate
mimic this
generate so the mimic is right in a
style that is conversational informative
and slightly playful now that's pretty
accurate suitable for readers at a high
school level the sentences are a mix of
medium and occasional long length
utilizing commas for clarity the tone is
balanced with a tone of touch of
enthusiasm engaging The Reader through
varied sentence structure detailed
explanations are provided without
overwhelming complexity and light humor
is used sparingly to maintain reader
interest throughout the text I really
like that actually so we can give this
mimic a name now I'll call this mimic of
Matt one I'm going to call it one
because we're going to generate this
again I don't want to lose this because
we we can't edit this this is our mimic
now so we'll save
it now it's in there mimic of mat one
but now what we can do if we want is we
can generate this again if we want to so
we'll put generate
mimic so write in the style that's
informative instructional casually
engage aging utilizing accessible
vocabulary light humor at a 2 out of 10
rating details provided at a 7 out of 10
level this is cool too so I'm actually
going to call this mimic of Mat 2 so I
have two different variations in here
we'll save the mimic and then what we
can do right now we've loaded mimic of
Mat 2 if we want to load mimic of mat
one we just click this right here click
this right here load number two right
now number two is loaded and then as we
will put in our blog post title like how
to get more back links and there we'll
configure our options and then as we
write this it will use that mimic now we
can look at the output if we don't like
the output if we don't like the style
that it's writing in we come up here and
we just load a different mimic load that
one now and now that one's loaded all
right if you don't like the mimics you
can come in here and you can delete the
mimic you can also regenerate and then
update the mimic if you want to we can
call this like default now or we could
regenerate and then rename this and we
can say update mimic and now it's called
default so that's how mimics work I'm
