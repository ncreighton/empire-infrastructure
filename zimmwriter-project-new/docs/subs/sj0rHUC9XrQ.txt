# Bulk Amazon Product Reviews with Custom Outlines in ZimmWriter

hey and welcome to another zimrider Academy training in this video I'm going to walk you through how to use the new custom outline feature to write some different product reviews for Amazon products although this could definitely apply for different products at other Merchant websites so let's dive in and get started so here's the two products we're going to write about we have a Shore sm7b microphone and there's some product details some more product information and then some product reviews that zimrider will look at and then we have a Logitech Blue Snowball snowball snowball ice microphone product details some more specs and some product reviews normally in the penny arcade you can put in your different URLs for these products now you're going to need scrape out if you want to do this if you want to scrape Amazon stuff you need scrape out for other sites you don't necessarily need scrape out but for Amazon you would you can put these two URLs in here and then Zoom writer will go to these pages and then script the data summarize it and then write an article the problem is if you just do this without a custom outline you are going to get different subheadings about different things and so the Articles could potentially Go in different directions they're both going to recommend the product the AI will do a good job of that recommending the product but maybe you want a custom format a common format between all of these different articles and that's where the custom outline will really help you I'm going to click on custom outline and I don't know if you watched the first training this is the second to training on the custom outline feature the first training I go a little bit more in depth into what this does so definitely check that out I'm going to try to link it below in the video description but there's directions for this custom outline you need to read the directions this is a situation where you need to read the directions don't email me that you that your custom outline is not working because what I'm going to do is I'm going to link you the directions you need to read this you need to read it a couple times you need to study this because this is a very Advanced feature immense amount of power but it's very tricky if you don't use it correctly so you need to understand how to use it properly I pre-generated a couple different articles let me open up the first one so this is I use DaVinci for most of this stuff and let's go to the other outline so here's the outline I used oh wait this is for pizza let's go to Amazon there we go so I I used key takeaways you can see the key takeaways the key takeaways would be this option right here and I did I enabled literary devices I believe I did a second person tone of voice I think I did Auto style and I believe that was it and then I used this custom outline right here so you'll see with the custom outline you can have a common format so in the custom outline I said I want an H2 called design so it gave us an H2 for each of these called design you'll appreciate the shore sm7b's Dynamic cartridge and air suspension shock isolation design you'll love the stylish directory design of the Logitech blue ice USB microphone so we have our H2 for that we have our H2 for performance we have our product specifications we have our pros and cons now this is a transition paragraph because below it we have two h3s again to do an H3 you would have one dash a minus sign and then a space and then your H3 if you want to do an H4 you'd have two minus signs although an H4 must follow an H3 you can't just have an H4 following an H2 pros and cons so here's our H3 Pros H3 cons H3 Pros H3 cons and then FAQs and this is so this is an actual I just put a heading in here I didn't use the FAQ checkbox down here you'll if you really want FAQs you probably get better mileage with something like this but if you do use if you do use this then you can't have the FAQs that this generates appear inside of here it would always appear at the end of here so just keep that in mind but I had to do some FAQs and then I had a section called final verdict I also disabled the conclusion if you don't disable the conclusion you'll also it will end up generating a conclusion after this too but you can you disable that and then have whatever you want at the end of that too so that's very basic it's a very basic custom outline now let's amp it up a notch and let's move on to the second example so I've modified it a little more I've optimized the title for design and I've added the YouTube video I've optimized the title for performance added a YouTube video product specs I optimized it and I added a table and then everything else is the same although for the pros and cons I told it to prompt the AI to write a list so let's open up let's see this is this sm7b let's open up this one right here all right so we have go back up to the top and compare so this is both for the sm7b microphone so original article we had design here's our design but then we added the variable optimized title that's the variable in curly brackets you can read all about this in the directions read the directions look at my previous training video so it optimized the title so instead of design it said design and features right then we said we want a YouTube video so it went out to the internet you need scrape out for that also and it found us a YouTube video which I love I just love going to these YouTube videos because they're actually relevant so it found us a YouTube video called how to set up the short sm7b for beginners awesome great way to boost your relevance in your page on time for this article all right performance proximity effect so you'll be pleased to know that this sm7b has low proximity effect due to its extended metal Grille this means that when you're recording vocals you won't get the usual bass heavy sound due to the closeness of the mic cool now it focused a little bit more so we optimized the title because it said performance optimize title so it focused more on this proximity effect whereas over here it's just a general performance it's still relevant over here but you'll have to realize maybe that you like this more maybe you like the basic the non-optimized title or maybe you like the optimized title because if we generate this again we'll get something different all right so you just get to figure out what you like more product specs we have our markdown table that was generated because we said give us a table and then also we optimize the title so product specifications and features nothing fancy but it did something it didn't change it a little bit and then we asked for a list in the pros and the cons so it gave us a list in the pros it didn't give us a list in the cons now zimrider did prompt the AI to write a list but sometimes the AI decides it doesn't want to play nice and doesn't want to write that list is that a deal breaker no you just don't have a list you can either be okay with that or you can add a list using a magic command or you could just generate this using a higher performance model like gpt4 but then the price goes up obviously so that's the second example let's load up the third example now so now I wanted to see I'm playing with this a little bit you're gonna have to play with this a lot to understand what it does and how it works for your specific situation because there's a limitless number of use cases I wanted to see if having an FAQ section I could because over here like here's the FAQs I could actually have it write h3s and then title those h3s as an actual question so I said FAQs here's an H3 question and then I said optimize the title here's an H3 question optimize title let's see what happens so question streaming performance so that's what it did it didn't say what's the streaming performance of this microphone it just said question streaming performance so my mileage did vary with that question I got a second question for stream of performance again question recording quality now that's the sm7b I believe when I did the snowball it was different or maybe it was the same let's see so this is same outline but the different the other product that blue ice snowball or Blue Snowball ice so Mouse so it said Mouse button question so instead of saying question colon Mouse button it says Mouse button question so I'm like I'm not getting the questions that I wanted so I generated another one and I said this time I'm not going to put the h3s in I'm going to have the AI do it so I said Auto h34 give me four h3s so here are the results here's the sm7b article so we'll scroll down so we actually have a question with the question mark ideal vocal range suitable for podcasting need for external preamp package concerns addressed valid valid FAQs but now realize now that's the sm7b same outline but this is the Blue Snowball down here the title didn't really become a question it's not a deal breaker but just realize even with the same outline your mileage can vary because if you're giving the AI freedom to do some different things you're not always going to get exactly what you intend in your mind so there's a lot of playing around with this that you'll need to need to figure out so I hope that helped you understand a little bit more about how to use this custom outline feature for Amazon posts or different types of product posts if you have different niches that you'd like me to work on with this and see if the custom outline could also apply drop a comment down below I'd be more than happy to make a video on that and see if we can come up with a custom outline that would fit your needs if you like this video please give it a thumbs up please drop a comment down below there's a link to zimwriter and all kinds of goodies in the description and if I don't talk to you again good luck with your content generation I'll talk to you later
