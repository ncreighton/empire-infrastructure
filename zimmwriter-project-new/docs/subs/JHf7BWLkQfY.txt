# Lesson 6 - How to Configure ZimmWriter

hey and welcome to your configuring Zim writer guide there are just some configuration steps that would be good to know some knowledge about where Zim riter keeps important files how to back things up I didn't really know where else to put them so they're best uh placed inside of this video it's going to be a short video but it should be very useful to you so I first want to open up the options menu because we're going to talk about some different things inside of here the most important option here would for most people would be the set directory to save blog so whenever you write something with the oneclick or the bulk or the penny arcade any feature inside of here and it spits out a file or some images or something by default it's going to store them in your Zim writer directory in this output folder you'll have all your text files and everything inside of here but maybe you want it to go somewhere else maybe you want it to go to your Dropbox folder or a flash drive or something like that you can set that right here and then all of the output will then go to that particular folder there's an option up here to disable all keyboard triggers if we check this and we press save when we leave the window all of our triggers will be temporarily disabled except for the exit the control Q will always remain active or whatever you've set the exit trigger to so and this is useful if you're playing a game or you're doing Photoshop or some kind of program that has a lot of different key bindings and zimer just keeps interacting with that this is a quick and easy way to just disable everything but just keep in mind that it will be disabled even when you restart WR so you'll want to reenable it if you want to start using those things again there's an option to disable extra stuff in file header now granted I could have probably named this a little bit better but in each of the text files that's generated except for the local SEO Buffet so in each of the files the the oneclick the bulk the penny arcade or whatever you'll have all this stuff at the top of the file and it all begins with this this at symbol right here if you click this box disabled stuff at at the top of the file header then then all this stuff right here will not appear you'll just have a nice file right here I personally find a lot of this information over here very useful and if you upload this to Wordpress like the auto upload that's built into Zim writer all the stuff will be automatically deleted on upload but will remain inside of the file so something to think about you might just want to leave this unchecked right here there's an option to speed up Zim writer by disabling the safety check calls in open AI I highly recommend leaving this unchecked you don't want to check this option open AI has things that you should not be generating some not safe for work things hate speech or violence or adult themed material you can't generate that stuff with open Ai and if you tried too many times to generate that kind of stuff they'll block your API account virtually all of the calls that Zim riter makes to open AI first pass through their safety check and it's completely free and it doesn't really take up a lot of time so it's highly recommended to to leave this as default which is unchecked and that way everything will first pass through those those safety checks first to make sure that open AI considers it safe to generate what else this is the place that you can change a new open AI key you can switch your key out with something different and you can also set your Zim Rider license inside of here if you have a subscription you upgrade it to a different version or something like that you can change that inside of here there's more options in here like scrape Al and scraping surgeon we'll talk about those in a later lesson now the last thing I want to talk about is the important files in Zim writer the first file is your settings file settings.ini this is a pretty important file it keeps I believe the sites that you've connected to Wordpress in there so your different sites that you've added I believe it stores that it also stores some different Advanced triggers and things like that so if you ever format your computer or you want to do a reinstall of Zim writer this is a file that you would want to keep you can just take it and copy it to your desktop or something like that and then when you unzip a new copy of Zim writer you can just drag and drop this inside no problem make sure whenever you're doing this kind of stuff Zoom writer's turned off to begin with like shut down you don't want to do anything I'm doing right here with zoom riter open the other place with important files is your database folder there's a couple different databases inside of here that store various settings for Zoom writer that you use this scraping store is a scraping cachee and there's some scraping settings and things like that so these would also be things that you might want to back up every now and then I've never had and we have thousands and thousands of Zim Rider users we've never really had an issue with these things crashing every couple months it might be worthwhile just to back up this stuff ideally I would just recommend closing Zim writer down and then going to outside of your folder and just going over here and compressing to a zip file and then we can say backup nice and easy might be worth it doing every couple months just to have some backups just in case something does happen so that's it that's the whole configuration everything you need to know about configuring the basics in Zim writer if you have any questions just drop me in the comments below otherwise I'll see you in the next lesson
