the button and there's some a directions link up here definitely read the directions this is a completely unique function inside of Zim riter read the whole thing the exhaustive guide it will really walk you through what everything does now before I show you the output I I want to show you something that I structured the output based on so there's this site here called Denver Pros friend of mine made it phenomenal site phenomenal layout for a local business so this is the cleaning service they have lots of locations they serve they have lots of services they offer and they'll have a page for every service for every location so if you have five Services five locations you'll have 25 Pages you have 25 Services 25 uh locations you'll have 625 Pages lots of content lots of Juicy o content here you'll see some different you'll see a tagline up here you'll see some different features highlights of the business you'll see some some text about the window cleaning that this company offers in Aurora Colorado so this is the service right here window cleaning or Aurora Colorado if we go to like dryer vent cleaning we'll see dryer vent cleaning Aurora Colorado and we'll see some different text for dryer vent cleaning in Aurora Colorado based on this particular company's offerings and then we can go to a different location like Castle Rock and then we scroll down and we find like upholstery cleaning and now we see upholstery cleaning in Castle Rock California I love the structure love the site amazing job you can replicate this with Zim writer now so this is the local SEO Buffet you'll put in your business type so we have a cleaning service you'll put in the name of your business the cleaning bros you'll put in one to five different highlights of your business we've been in business for 15 years 500 F star Reviews free estimates same day service etc etc then you'll put in up to 25 different locations that your business serves you can leave some of these blank if you want to you don't have to fill them all out but I just filled out the default five right here and then you can fill out up to 25 services that your business offers now each business you'll put in like window cleaning carpet cleaning bathroom cleaning whatever for each service that your business offers you can put an unique selling proposition so we'd say like window cleaning we offer the rain Defender it cleans Windows spotless leaves Windows streak free rain runs right off your windows carpet cleaning we offer the B dry quick dry system it leaves your carpets less damp moves furniture back to your carpet faster less chance for mold and Milo but then for bathroom cleaning we didn't fill out any of that stuff come down here you can select your voice if you want lary devices and the model if you choose a GPT 3.5 turbo this is like a penny per p age of content I chose GPT 4 so it's about seven seven pennies but you could charge a local business 10 bucks 15 bucks per page of content the the return on investment is insane let me show you what the output looks like so again for every service that you fill in in every business that you fill in you'll have a a multiplication of the content that you'll get five Services five locations 25 files 25 Services 25 locations 625 files lots of stuff now this this is stuff I call it a buffet and this is the most important takeaway to get from this entire video this is a buffet because the files generated see all these different files I generated are not meant to just immediately publish it's meant to be a buffet you're supposed to take what you want and discard the rest so here are two examples this is carpet cleaning for Hudson Ohio and this is carpet cleaning for Columbus Ohio so the AI used our let's go back in here used our carpet cleaning service for both these locations Columbus and Hudson and then it also talked about this B dry quick dry system based on these USPS these benefits of the USP and then it also talked about these highlights so let me show you how it works it's really cool so we have a meta title now this is something you can put in the meta description if you an SEO plugin echo-friendly carpet

Ohio go-to team for sustainable cleaning services what's cool is these businesses don't need actual locations in like physical locations in the areas that they serve these are just literally areas that they serve so they don't need a physical presence there so this is a tldr now what can you use this thing for whatever you want maybe you have a section on your page that you want to use this for so this is like a too long didn't read here are some different features 15 years trusted clean experts 15E cleaning expertise so they're different they sound different spun those features that you

and you repeat that template for all your different locations and you just pick out what you want for it then we have some frequently asked questions what types of carpet cleaning methods do you use how long does it take for the carpet to dry after cleaning usually takes four to 6 hours so some of this stuff is information that you did not provide the AI just came up with but this is a reasonable response so you can put some frequently asked questions and answers on your page now here are some different dishes so like stain removal and carpet cleaning we're tackling the challenge of stain removal during carpet cleaning we know it's about much more than just just getting rid of of spots it's about rejuvenating your beloved carpet and bringing back its original Splendor that's awesome when we're faced with a stubborn stand on our carpet the first thing we often feel is a scent of dread etc etc great content unique content different than each other because it's just mind- numbing when you have 25 different locations that all need to talk about carpet cleaning how do you write something different for each location it's just it's terrible you don't want to do that that's where AI can really shine now usually the delicious dish number four is the area that's going to talk about your USP if you provided one so here we go here's the USP for carpet cleaning we know how
