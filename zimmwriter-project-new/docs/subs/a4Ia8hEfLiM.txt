# Lesson 2 - How to Use the SEO Writer

hey and welcome to the beginner guide to getting started with the SEO writer inside of Zim writer this is going to be a short video if you want a much deeper dive I have a video on that also but this is just going to give you a highle overview of using the SEO writer at the end of the video you should be able to generate a couple different articles with the SEO writer and also know when to use the SEO writer so you'll find the SEO writer right here next to the one click writer so SEO writer we'll click it we'll open up the menu now before we talk about the menu I want to close it so you don't get distracted I want to talk about when we would want to use the SEO writer cuz there's a lot of different ways to write content inside of Zim writer last video we talked about the one click in the bulk writer when would you want to use those versus the SEO writer the one click in the bulk are great for Content that the AI either knows about or if you enable Ser scraping that the Ser knows about the SEO writer is good when you have information that the AI doesn't know about or the Ser doesn't know about and you're going to feed that information to the AI the SEO writer is also very useful when you want to completely customize your outline you can do your h3s exactly how you want your h4s your H2S everything is completely configurable to your particular taste and settings on an article by article basis now the downside is it's one article at a time there's no Q there's no bulk for it so if you want to do bulk use the bulk writer but if you're going a little bit slower and more methodically use the SEO writer so open up the SEO writer right here now again I'm going to hammer this point in Click the directions link it's going to take you to my SEO writer exhaustive guide spent a lot of time on this guide I'll scroll down here I don't know how many thousands of words this is but it truly is an exhaustive guide it will answer 95% of all your questions so read that guide very important so the first thing you can do in here is you can set your blog post title five steps to get good grades in college so we can put our blog post title in here we're not going to talk about Ser scraping that will be for the advanced video you'll see a global background box and this is an area that we can put in some background information that the AI would not know about now this particular topic right here the AI probably can come up with something fairly decent but if this was like five steps to dis I can't spell I can't spell in real time disassemble a for V8 engine the AI is going to have no idea whatsoever so this would be an example of where you would want to put potentially Supply some background information information that the AI does not know this is not where you put prompts in you don't put in I want you to write like at an eighth grade level I want you to not repeat yourself and stuff you don't put prompts in the global background and then you can set your number of H2S that you want so we can say we want five H2S or we want 10 H2S let's put 10 in here and when you put it in here you'll have to click somewhere else to make it all change it refreshes and now we have our 10 H2S couple different options in here there's an explanation in here about how you can create your outline somewhere else and then press this button to copy it all in Let me actually demonstrate that for you here's an and it has to be in a specific format you got to follow the directions very important I'm going to copy this and I'll click this button right here it actually will create our H2S or h3s or h4s all that good stuff for you has to be in the appropriate format we erase the settings so we can start fresh five steps to get into college and we have five different H2S so we copied from the clipboard but we can also just use the AI to generate our headings so I'll click this button and we'll wait a second don't type anything just be patient sometimes open AI might hang a little bit so it might take a little bit longer but it came up with some different headings research potential colleges prepare standardized test build strong extracurricular uh profile that sounds pretty good now if we want to we can put some h3s in here and we can actually expand this and start configuring some more options but we'll cover that in the advanced video so we have five different headings in here we can configure some length some voice we'll talk about all these different options in the advanced video and then you can put some SEO keywords in here too these would be keywords that you'd get from like phrase or Market Muse or Surfer or something like that these can be uh line after line you could say SAT scores practice tests they can be on new lines or they can be comma separated if you want to now when you're done you'll just click either of these buttons here you are able to scrape URLs we'll talk about that in the advanced video but once everything's scraped already or you don't have any URLs it doesn't really matter what button you click so we'll just click this button and it will say it's starting to write the article so that's all you have to do couple minutes later you'll get your article again it will be in the output folder in your Zim writer directory unless you specified a different folder for it so that's it you should be able to generate articles Now using the SEO writer if you want more of a deeper dive definitely check out my advanced video on this other than that if you like the video please give it a thumbs up
