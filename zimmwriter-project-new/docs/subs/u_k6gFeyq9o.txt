# ZimmWriter Topical Authority Update (+ Usage Tips)

hey I want to share with you some updates to the topical Authority generator inside of Zim Rider also known as tag and I think you'll really appreciate these updates because it it dramatically increases the quality and also empowers you with a lot more flexibility with what you can do with it so if you're not familiar with tag you can definitely check out my previous video on this but you can find it in the AI Vault and the uh topical Authority generator button okay now all of the options in here are going to look the same but you'll notice something different for the topical clusters you can now select up to 30 topical clusters and up to 30 different longtails now the total number of blog titles you can pick is still going to be limited to a th000 so 30 * 30 is going to be 900 blog post titles if we're doing one title each we can't like round this up to a TH or something you'll get 900 out you'll get one one blog title for each long tail for each topical cluster okay now if you go down to 10 for instance and 25 then we can choose four and that will will give us a nice even 1,000 blog post titles for each longtail that you want now some people don't want the blog post titles so some people are like I don't want the blog post titles I just want topical clusters and long tails you can do that now okay the blog post titles now has a zero option over here if you click zero you'll get a little addendum down here it says note setting zero blog post titles it's much faster and much less expensive so if we go over here to I think it's carrying for newborn baby I think that's what I did yeah so this is on gp4 and I did 30 clusters and 30 longtails and I got 900 results 900 rows and the total cost was 70 cents so instead of the the cost of being like $45 which is typical with 900 or th000 rows now it's only 70 cents now this didn't give you those blog post titles there's no columns for that there's no merged columns or anything like that okay because we don't have those blog post titles we just have the longtail keywords and the Clusters now why might you want this maybe you want to spend more time fleshing out this idea maybe you really want to go you know step by step through this and really uh not just rely on the AI to create your clusters but see what the ai's come up with and then start using your own brain and and using other resource sources to come up with your perfect topical Authority map and a lot of people do just want to do that you could also just sell this to a client you could Spruce this up a little bit and sell it to a client but yeah this entire thing with the gp4 was only 70 cents the other thing you'll notice is the quality of the output is has really skyrocketed up so you'll have a lot more categories now that will actually be two words in here and then a lot of the the blog post titles will actually be better quality in relation to what they're supposed to be like the what post now it's actually a lot of times going to start with what it will do it a lot better with gp4 now all right but even turbo has gotten a boost the the how-to post so this didn't start out as a how-to maybe that would in the gp4 but the lisal post now we have a 10 simple tips guide post didn't really say guide historical post the evolution of dorm room productivity so you're going to get a lot higher quality with GPT 3.5 turbo and GPT 4 when it comes to the blog post titles all right so that's the updates with this let me talk about a couple tips and tricks to using this based on the feedback that I've gotten in the past week so you can go through here and let's say we you use your brain to like delete stuff that you don't want that you don't think would work out well and you end up with this list of blog post titles that you want to write about so what you can do is you can take after cleaning it the result of your cleaning and copy it just from the this is the blog post title column you can copy those and go over here to the bulk writer and paste it in okay these are all the the blog post titles we want to now write an article about we can click Start blog writer we'll say okay I'm going to write 21 blog posts it's really easy to do now the other thing you can do is you can just select stuff like this but the problem is when you select stuff like and you hold down control or shift or whatever it is to select things and you copy it if you go to zoom writer to paste it in or anywhere to paste it in it's going to paste in like the stuff that wasn't select like the stuff in between the rows so what you'll have to do is open another Excel Tab and then paste it in there and then copy from there and then paste it into Zim writer it's just like an Excel type of issue so to speak that's just if you want to write about the blog post titles okay and you don't have to do it in the bulk by the way before before I explain more you can say you know what this won't really work well in the bulk this particular title right here so I'm going to go over here to the SEO writer and I'm going to write about it inside of here okay or maybe you want to write about it in the bulk SEO CSV we have all these titles but they all need oops there we go they all need like some background information or something like that so you can load up the bulk SEO CSV file and we can just come in here and delete this stuff and start putting in some new columns with data for article titles you can put in the outline Focus if you want now if you put in the outline Focus you're not going to use the like the brackets and things like that inside of here it would simply be you'd have to like manually come in here and just take this portion right here just like the sentence portion not with the brackets and the stuff and you'd have to go to there and put it in like that then you could get some background information you could go and either just paste in the paragraphs that you want or you could paste in some different headings where you can paste in a couple different URLs you can completely create the outline and you can put in some SEO keywords if you want to you can even put in your own category if you want to so maybe you want to use the bulk SEO CSC file all right what you can also do is you can use this merged column over here now this merged column if we take some of these we paste these into the bulk writer of Zim writer so just write in this box right here it will create a first article called what are essential tips for surviving dorm life it will create a category called dorm Essentials in a assign the written article to that category and it will'll also use this outline Focus okay then when it finishes writing this it will go into the next article here's the next article we'll write it assign it to this category and use this outline Focus as it creates the outline so this is another way to do it now maybe you don't want the categories automatically created maybe you want to use categories that are inside of here you can do that too Zim writer is completely flexible so what we can do if we just want that is we can say the merged column I want this is where you do the excel math a little bit you put an equal sign and you go over here to the title select the title and you press and and then select the outline Focus okay so E3 and G3 and there we go and then we just fill down so now we have in the merged column just the outline focus and just the title of the article I think there's some stuff that we deleted in here so yeah you'd have to yeah if you're going to delete stuff you need to make sure that you delete like the whole row otherwise it's going to screw you up so how I get in here and delete the whole row there we go okay so now you can safely paste this stuff in and it will make sense all right so we paste this in and there you go so now it will write the article what are essential tips for surviving dorm life and then it will use this outline Focus but it won't assign any categories unless you go over here and select a specific category that you want from the drop down so you can have it just assigned to all the it has to go somewhere you can go to all or you can select a particular caramel popcorn that that can be our category right there what else some people keep asking they're like do I need to write every single blog title in here isn't there going to be cannibalization yeah there could be that's why you need to go through this with your brain and depending on how important this site is to you or this longtail cluster is to you or this topical cluster is to you go through it and figure out what you want to delete and what you actually want to write about because before this it would take a heck of a lot longer to figure out what you want to write and whatnot but now we've saved you a lot of time with tag but you still need to use some of that brain power there's nothing you don't want a one-click solution if you had a one-click solution then everybody would be using the one-click solution and no one would rank so you put in a little bit more effort than the competition all right because there's a lot of lazy people out there you put in a little bit more effort and it will will pay dividends for you I think that's it we've covered the improvements to tag we've covered how to how to put stuff in you can either put the blog post title column in you can put stuff from over here in the merged column in you can use it in the SEO writer you can use it in the bulk SEO CSV a lot of different options and realize when you put stuff in here you can still use these options down here as long as they don't conflict okay so as long as there's no conflicting things down here you can create a completely bespoke article tailored to your particular Niche that's going to be unique and and no one else is going to have something else like it so very few AI Solutions offer that kind of
