# Lesson 5 - How to Use Magic Commands

hey and welcome to your beginner guide to getting started with magic commands inside of Zim riter magic commands will always hold a very special place in my heart because that is the origin story of Zim Rider I wanted to to build something that I could use AI anywhere on my desktop computer and anywhere online and that is what a Magic command allows you to do but now Zim riter has morphed into a tool well beyond magic commands but it all started from Magic command so what is a magic command how does it work and how can you apply it in your use case your spefic specific scenario so a magic command is simply a command or a question that we give to the AI and we get a response back so in a way it's chat GPT but there are some striking differences so I'm in notepad plus right now but again you can type a magic command or access the AI anywhere so you can replace this with your favorite tool whether it's word or PowerPoint or Chrome or Edge or Firefox or LinkedIn or Google Docs or wherever you can type text you can use a magic command but we're just going to do this in notepad right now so what you do is you'll type a question or a command so we're going to do a question first I'll highlight the text you got to highlight the text because what happens is you highlight the text you press the keyboard trigger and Zim writer will copy what you've highlighted send it to open AI open AI will respond and then Zim writer will paste the result onto the screen so we've highlighted the text I'll press control1 because that's my default key for a magic command Zim writer sent this to open AI open AI responded Zim writer pasted the result on the screen the Sun is hot because of the nuclear of nuclear fusion occurring in its core now one big difference between this and chat GPT is Zim writer only processes what you highlight so if we come down here and say write some more about this subject and highlight it and press control1 the AI is going to have no idea what we're talking about because all we're feeding the AI is this right here see the AI has no idea it says however I'm not sure which subject you're referring to chat GPT is different all chat GPT is is essentially a a giant magic command that's feeding the entire conversation up to a certain point back into the AI now we can do that if we want we can do that in Zim writer so I can take all this text highlight it and press control one and Z riter will send this to the AI the AI will understand that we want more about the subject of why is Sun High and then it will do that but there comes to be a point that it's not economical so I wouldn't necessarily ditch your chat GPT subscription sometimes it is convenient to have that conversation with the AI and obviously it's either free or if you're paying for the plus the $20 a month it's very inexpensive so there's a time and a place for magic commands there's a time and a place for chat GPT so we've shown you how to use this question magic command Let's do an actual command now so right an outline for a blog post about the Sun so this would be more of a command I'll highlight it I'll press control1 we'll wait a moment now again Zim writer is going to paste this result wherever your cursor is so if we click somewhere else we're Zim writer is not going to remember or not going to know that this is where we were originating so if you click somewhere else Zim writer won't paste here you might be like oh man I just lost all my output it might be stored in the clipboard somewhere so right I opened up a new little window let me press contrl V yeah and I still have my output saved in the clipboard so just a usage tip in case you don't have any patience and you click somewhere else you still might have your output so here is our outline right here now one thing I want to mention is there are bad prompts that you don't want to be using inside of Zim right I don't mean like unsafe prompts I just mean like through my three years of prompt engineering I've seen a lot of just I would classify them as nasty prompts they're like three paragraphs long they just have too many directions there's conflicting directions the AI follows some of it it doesn't follow all of it save that stuff for chat GPT put that stuff in chat GPT because it's going to get expensive since your prompts are very long and it's just not ideal for a magic command a magic command is very useful for surgical precise things that you're trying to do with the AI it's it's also great magic command is also great for developing your prompts because your prompts won't be biased based on a previous conversation whereas if you try to develop a prompt inside of chat GPT it's going to be biased The Prompt that you're creating based on the entire conversation before it even if you type some one of those strings forget everything above this line and then do this when you're in chat GPT and you tell it to do something else it doesn't really forget everything above the line all of this is still being fed into the AI so just realize sometimes you want to use chpt other times you want a surgical Precision or AI anywhere you're going to be wanting to use a magic command now there are two different keyboard triggers two additional keyboard triggers that we can use the continue writing and the rewriting so let me show you how that works so let's go back to what we had why is the sun hot awesome continue writing I'll highlight the text and I'll press control 2 and Zim writer will continue the conversation now this is very useful if you're editing a document you're in WordPress or something like that and you just want to add a little bit more text to what whatever you're writing about this is perfect for that it's very quick and easy you can also rewrite the content so let me take this and I'll duplicate it so you can see the original and the Rewritten and I'll highlight it and I'll press control 4 and the rewriting sometimes it gives you something completely different I mean it's still on point but sometimes it just improves the grammar a little bit bit so there's the original and then there's the Rewritten the sun's hot because of nuclear fusion the sun's hot because of nuclear fusions happening in its core now sometimes we don't want the original left in here all right or sometimes when we run a magic command we don't want the original command left in here or question left in here see it's left in here maybe we're on Facebook and we're writing a Facebook post or we're writing an email or something like that and we don't want whatever we're highlighting the command or the question in here so what you can do is you can go to the options menu in Zim writer and check this button or this check box right here don't display magic command and rewrite input on completion so if we check that and we click save what happens is when I now highlight this and press control1 this will be replaced with just our output and now you can always go back and press contrl Z but there's use cases for that I'm trying to give you all the different use cases and then finally all of these commands are issued by triggers you can change those triggers in this change triggers window right here so all the triggers start with control right now but we can vary that up we can have them start with Control Alt or control shift and then we can change up the actual numbers for them we can put a letter in here or a number just to make sure that whatever you're putting in here you're going to actually remember and use the reason for and the reason for changing these up is maybe you have a conflict maybe you have another program that already uses control 3 or something like that so that might be a use case for changing these up so that's it that's the beginner guide to using magic commands I'm excited about the more advanced training that's going to come where we're going to do a deeper dive into the advanced triggers there is so much power in here I can't wait to share it with you so if this video is helpful please give it a thumbs up drop a comment down below if you have any questions subscribe to my
