> Source: https://www.rankingtactics.com/zimmwriter-seo-keywords-to-titles/

## Overview

ZimmWriter's "SEO Keywords to Blog Post Titles" feature converts up to 1,000 SEO keywords into 5,000 blog post titles automatically.

## Workflow Steps

### Step 1: Gather Keywords
Obtain keywords from any SEO tool such as SEMRUSH, Ahrefs, NeuronWriter, WriterZen, or Keyword Chef.

### Step 2: Input Keywords
Copy and paste your keyword list into ZimmWriter's dedicated function.

### Step 3: Configure Settings
- Assign a job name
- Select your preferred GPT model
- Initiate generation by clicking the start button

### Step 4: Generate Output
The system generates five title variations per keyword and produces a CSV file within minutes.

## Output Structure

The CSV file contains:
- **Original keyword** column
- **Five title options** for each keyword
- **Recommended title** (selected based on keyword term matching)
- **WordPress slug** (exact-match keyword format)
- **Merged column** (combines recommended title + slug for direct WordPress upload)

## Example Output

For "seo keywords for photographers," the system created options like "3 SEO Keywords Every Photographer Needs to Know," selecting the best match automatically.

## Integration

Users can paste the merged column directly into ZimmWriter's Bulk Writer feature, which automatically sets article slugs when uploading to WordPress.

## Important Limitation

ZimmWriter does not SERP scrape the input keywords to preserve API credits and processing time, potentially limiting accuracy for niche or brand-specific terms.
