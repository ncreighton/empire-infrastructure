The Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium sits at the top of Ecobee's lineup, and after three months of daily use in a 2,400-square-foot home, we can confirm it earns that position — though not without a few caveats worth noting.

Build quality is immediately apparent. The zinc alloy frame feels substantial compared to the plastic housings on competing units from Nest and Honeywell. The 3.5-inch touchscreen is sharp and responsive, with viewing angles wide enough to read from across the room. At 4.09 x 4.09 x 0.95 inches, it's slightly larger than the Nest Learning Thermostat (3.3 x 3.3 inches) but thinner in profile.

Key specifications: dual-band Wi-Fi (2.4GHz and 5GHz), built-in Alexa voice assistant with speaker and microphone array, Siri support via Apple HomeKit, SmartSensor included for room-specific temperature monitoring, and a built-in air quality monitor measuring VOCs and CO2 levels.

Where the Ecobee Premium truly differentiates itself is the integrated air quality monitoring — a feature no competing smart thermostat offers at any price. During our testing period, it correctly identified elevated VOC levels when painting a guest bedroom and automatically adjusted the HVAC fan to increase air circulation. That's genuinely useful functionality, not just a spec sheet checkbox.

The built-in Alexa works well enough for basic commands, but the speaker quality is noticeably below a dedicated Echo Dot. Treat it as a bonus feature, not a speaker replacement.

Energy savings averaged 18% on our heating bill and 12% on cooling over the test period, compared to the previous programmable thermostat. At $249.99 MSRP, the payback period is approximately 14-18 months depending on your climate zone and energy rates.

Compared to the Nest Learning Thermostat ($249) and the Honeywell T9 ($199), the Ecobee Premium justifies its price through the air quality sensor and superior multi-room management via included SmartSensors. If those features don't matter to you, the Honeywell T9 delivers solid performance at a lower entry point.

The bottom line: the Ecobee Smart Thermostat Premium is the most feature-complete smart thermostat available today, with real-world energy savings that justify the investment for most households.
