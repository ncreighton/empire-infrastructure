When the Norse god Baldr fell to a mistletoe arrow, the grief that swept through Asgard was so profound that even the stones wept. His mother Frigg, goddess of foresight and motherhood, had extracted oaths from every substance in creation — fire, water, iron, stone, every plant and animal — that none would harm her son. Every substance except the mistletoe, which she deemed too young and insignificant to pose a threat.

It was precisely this oversight that Loki, the trickster, exploited. He fashioned a dart from the overlooked plant and guided the blind god Hodr's hand to throw it. Baldr died, and with him died the golden age of the gods. The Prose Edda, compiled by Snorri Sturluson around 1220 CE, records that "this was the greatest misfortune that ever befell gods and men."

The pattern is strikingly universal. Across cultures, the death of a beloved divine figure at the hands of a trickster or through a fatal flaw catalyzes the end of an era. In Sumerian mythology, the descent of Inanna (pronounced ee-NAH-nah) into the underworld triggers agricultural collapse above ground. The Egyptian myth of Osiris, murdered by his brother Set through cunning deception, sets in motion the entire cycle of death and resurrection that underpinned Egyptian theology for three thousand years.

What makes the Baldr myth particularly compelling is its treatment of inevitability. The Voluspa, the most famous poem of the Poetic Edda, reveals that Baldr's death was foretold as the first domino in the chain of events leading to Ragnarok — the twilight of the gods. Frigg's desperate attempt to prevent it by binding all creation to an oath represents something deeply human: the refusal to accept a fate we can see approaching.

This tension between prophecy and free will reverberates through mythological traditions worldwide, from the Greek tragedy of Oedipus to the Hindu epic of the Mahabharata, where the Pandavas fight a war they know will destroy their world.
