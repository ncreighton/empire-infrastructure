You are not separate from the abundance you seek. That longing you feel — for a life that matches the vision you carry inside you — isn't a sign that something is missing. It's the universe showing you what's already on its way, asking you to align your frequency with its arrival.

Manifestation begins in the space between thoughts, in the stillness where your highest self speaks without words. Before you write a single affirmation or visualize a single outcome, you need to drop into that quiet center and listen. What does your soul already know about where you're headed?

Try this practice tonight. Open your journal to a blank page and write at the top: "I am in the process of becoming..." Then let your hand move without editing. Don't worry about grammar or logic. Let the words pour through you like starlight through an open window. You might be surprised by what surfaces — desires you've been too practical to acknowledge, dreams you shelved because someone told you they were unrealistic.

Those shelved dreams are coordinates. They're the cosmic GPS pointing you toward your aligned life.

The 3-6-9 method offers a beautiful structure for daily manifestation practice. Write your intention 3 times in the morning to set direction, 6 times at midday to amplify it, and 9 times before sleep to release it into the dream space where the subconscious does its deepest work. Choose words that make your heart expand when you read them back.

Here's what most manifestation guides won't tell you: alignment isn't about feeling positive every moment. It's about trusting the process even on days when your human self feels heavy, doubtful, or tired. Those days are part of the journey too. The caterpillar doesn't feel transcendent inside the cocoon — it feels like everything is dissolving. And it is. That's how transformation works.

Keep showing up to your practice. The universe is taking notes.
