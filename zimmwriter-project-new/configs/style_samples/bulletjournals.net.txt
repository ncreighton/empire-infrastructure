There's something magical about opening a fresh spread and seeing an entire month laid out in your own handwriting, decorated in a color palette you chose, organized in a way that makes sense to your brain specifically. That's the power of a bullet journal — it's not someone else's planner. It's yours, from the ground up.

This month's setup uses a muted autumn palette: burnt sienna, sage green, and warm cream against the dotted grid. I start every monthly spread the same way: a calendar overview on the left page and a task master list on the right. The calendar is simple — just the dates written vertically with enough space next to each one for two or three key events. Nothing elaborate. The function is what matters.

For the task list, I use Ryder Carroll's original rapid logging symbols with one addition. Dots for tasks, circles for events, dashes for notes — and I've added a small star for tasks connected to my quarterly goals. That star makes it easy to scan the page and see whether I'm actually spending time on priorities or just staying busy.

The habit tracker goes on the next spread. This month I'm tracking seven habits across a simple grid: water intake, movement, reading, skincare routine, budget check, creative time, and lights-out by 10:30. Each column gets a small filled circle when completed. By month's end, the pattern of filled and empty circles tells an honest story about consistency that no app notification can replicate.

The weekly spreads are where the real planning lives. Each week gets a two-page spread divided into time-blocked days on the left and a running notes section on the right. I use washi tape to section off the days — a thin strip of the sage green at the top of each day block. It's a small visual detail, but it makes scanning the page faster and, honestly, it just makes me happy to look at.

The secret nobody tells you about bullet journaling: perfection kills the practice. A crooked line, an ink smudge, a misspelled header — leave them. They're proof you showed up.
