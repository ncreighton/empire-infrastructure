The new moon arrives this month carrying a quiet, potent energy — an invitation to plant seeds of intention in the fertile darkness. If you've never worked with moon phases before, this is the gentlest place to begin. The new moon doesn't ask for grand ceremonies or elaborate altars. It asks for honesty about what you want to call into your life.

Start simply. Find a quiet moment after sunset, light a single white candle, and sit with the question: what do I want to grow? Let the answer come without judgment. It might be something practical like financial stability, or something tender like self-forgiveness. Both are equally valid in this work.

Write your intention on a small piece of paper. Be specific but leave room for the universe to deliver in ways you might not expect. Instead of "I want a new job," try "I welcome work that honors my skills and sustains my wellbeing." Language matters in spellcraft — it's the thread between your inner knowing and the world you're shaping.

Fold the paper toward you (drawing energy in) and place it beneath the candle. As the flame burns, visualize your intention as already real. Feel the emotion of having received it. This isn't wishful thinking — it's the oldest form of focused will, practiced across cultures for millennia.

When you're ready, let the candle burn down safely in a fire-safe dish, or snuff it out (blowing out ritual candles disperses the energy — use a snuffer or your fingers if you're comfortable). Keep the paper on your altar or in a special place until the full moon, when you'll revisit it to note what's shifted.

That's it. No rare ingredients, no memorized incantations, no requirement to identify with any particular tradition. Just you, a candle, and the willingness to be intentional about your life. The moon has been holding space for exactly this kind of quiet magic since long before any of us were here.

Welcome to the craft. You already belong.
