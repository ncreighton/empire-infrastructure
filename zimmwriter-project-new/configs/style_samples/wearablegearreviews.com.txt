I wore the Garmin Forerunner 265 for six weeks straight — through 23 runs, 8 strength sessions, two 50-mile bike rides, and one ill-advised trail race in freezing rain. Here's what the data tells me about whether this watch deserves its spot in the $400 GPS watch category.

Heart rate accuracy was the first thing I tested. Using a Polar H10 chest strap as the control, the Forerunner 265's wrist-based optical sensor stayed within 2-3 BPM during steady-state runs below 160 BPM. During high-intensity intervals where my heart rate spiked above 175, the wrist sensor lagged by 4-8 seconds and occasionally underread by up to 7 BPM. That's consistent with other wrist-based sensors and acceptable for most training purposes, but serious interval athletes will still want a chest strap.

GPS tracking impressed me. On a measured 10K course, the Forerunner 265 recorded 6.22 miles across five runs — within 0.3% of the actual distance. The multi-band GPS locked on in under 8 seconds every time, even under heavy tree cover on wooded trails where my previous watch would lose signal entirely.

The AMOLED display is the headline upgrade from the 255, and it genuinely changes the user experience. Pace data is readable at a glance in direct sunlight, and the always-on mode — which I kept enabled — still delivered 11 days of battery life with 45 minutes of daily GPS tracking. Garmin claims 13 days; I'd call 11 realistic with my usage patterns.

Recovery metrics are where Garmin's ecosystem pulls ahead of competitors. The morning report combines HRV status, sleep quality, and training load to deliver a readiness score that I found surprisingly accurate. On days it recommended a rest day, my actual performance in evening runs confirmed the assessment — my pace suffered and perceived effort was elevated.

At $399, it sits between the Coros Pace 3 ($299) and the Garmin Forerunner 965 ($599). For runners who want reliable data without entering the luxury tier, the 265 hits the sweet spot between capability and value.
