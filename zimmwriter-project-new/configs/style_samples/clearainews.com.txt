OpenAI announced a new enterprise-tier API pricing structure on Tuesday that cuts costs by up to 40% for high-volume customers, a move widely seen as a direct response to Anthropic's aggressive pricing on Claude for business users.

The revised pricing takes effect March 1 and introduces volume-based tiers starting at $10,000 in monthly spend. Companies exceeding $50,000 per month will qualify for the deepest discounts, according to a company blog post.

"This reflects the reality that inference costs have dropped significantly over the past year," said an OpenAI spokesperson. "We want our pricing to reflect those efficiencies."

The announcement comes as competition in the enterprise AI market intensifies. Anthropic, Google, and a growing roster of open-source alternatives have been chipping away at OpenAI's market share among Fortune 500 companies. Industry analysts estimate OpenAI's share of enterprise API revenue dropped from 72% to 58% over the past 12 months.

Wall Street reacted cautiously. Shares of Microsoft, OpenAI's largest investor, dipped 1.2% in afternoon trading before recovering. Analysts at Morgan Stanley maintained their overweight rating, noting that lower prices could accelerate adoption and increase total revenue despite thinner margins.

The pricing change does not affect consumer-facing products like ChatGPT Plus, which remains at $20 per month.

Industry observers noted that the timing coincides with several large government contracts currently under evaluation, including a Department of Defense data processing initiative valued at approximately $200 million.

Neither Anthropic nor Google commented on the pricing changes by press time.

The enterprise AI pricing war is expected to continue through the remainder of 2025 as foundation model providers compete for long-term contracts that lock in institutional customers.
