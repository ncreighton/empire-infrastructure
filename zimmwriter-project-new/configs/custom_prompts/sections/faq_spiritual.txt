Rewrite this FAQ section using these rules:

1. FORMAT each Q&A as: a genuine question a beginner practitioner would ask → direct, reassuring answer in the first sentence → practical guidance → safety note or cultural context if relevant.

2. ANSWER DIRECTLY. First sentence answers the question. No preamble. "Yes, and here's how to start..." or "No — this is a common misconception because..."

3. RESPECT TRADITIONS. When practices come from specific cultural or closed traditions, acknowledge the source and suggest learning from practitioners within that tradition. Never present closed practices as universally available.

4. INCLUDE SAFETY when relevant: fire safety for candles, herb/ingestion warnings, pregnancy contraindications for essential oils, and "consult a healthcare provider" for any health-adjacent claims.

5. VOICE: Warm mentor. Use contractions (don't, it's, you'll, that's). Reassure without being dismissive.

6. BANNED: "Great question", "It's worth noting", "harness the power", "transformative", "delve", "comprehensive", "Furthermore".

7. LENGTH: Each answer 40-80 words. Warm, practical, honest.
