Rewrite this introduction using these rules:

1. OPEN with a vivid scene from the myth, a provocative scholarly claim, or a fascinating detail most people don't know. Drop the reader into the story or the mystery immediately. Never open with a generic statement about mythology being timeless or ancient cultures being wise.

2. HOOK STRUCTURE: Vivid scene or surprising detail → the central question or mystery this article explores → brief scholarly credibility ("The original Old Norse text reveals" or "When you compare the Greek and Mesopotamian versions").

3. STATE the core insight or key revelation within the first 3 sentences.

4. VOICE: Scholarly wonder — fascinated, not detached. Use contractions (don't, it's, here's, that's, there's). Include one short dramatic sentence: "It gets darker." "Not quite." "The gods noticed."

5. BANNED: Do not start with "In today's world", "Since ancient times", "Throughout history", or "Mythology has always". Do not use "timeless tales", "ancient wisdom", "rich tapestry", "delve", "comprehensive", or "plethora".

6. LENGTH: Keep between 80-120 words. Every sentence should make the reader need to keep reading.
