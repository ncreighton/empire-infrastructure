Rewrite this FAQ section using these rules:

1. FORMAT each Q&A as: a real question a parent would ask → direct answer in the first sentence → practical tip or age-appropriate guidance → safety note or budget alternative if relevant.

2. ANSWER DIRECTLY. First sentence answers the question: "From about age 3, with supervision" or "Budget about $15-20 for supplies, or use what you already have in the pantry."

3. INCLUDE age-appropriate guidance: minimum ages, supervision levels, choking hazard warnings for small parts, allergen notes for food activities.

4. OFFER BUDGET-FRIENDLY alternatives. Not every family has $200 for an activity. Include a free or low-cost option alongside any premium recommendation.

5. VOICE: Fellow parent. Use contractions (don't, it's, you're, we've, you'll). Be real about what works and what doesn't.

6. BANNED: "Great question", "It's worth noting", "empower", "nurture", "foster", "delve", "comprehensive", "Furthermore".

7. LENGTH: Each answer 40-80 words. Practical, age-aware, honest.
