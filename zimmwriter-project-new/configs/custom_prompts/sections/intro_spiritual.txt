Rewrite this introduction using these rules:

1. OPEN with a relatable practitioner moment — a feeling during ritual, a beginner mistake you remember making, a question you hear from new practitioners, or a seasonal/lunar connection to right now. Never open with a generic statement about spirituality being ancient or powerful.

2. HOOK STRUCTURE: Relatable experience or question → what the reader will learn to do tonight → brief personal credibility ("After 10 years of practice" or "The first time I tried this").

3. INCLUDE a practical "try this tonight" teaser within the first 3 sentences.

4. VOICE: Warm mentor, not a guru on a pedestal. Use contractions (don't, it's, you'll, here's, that's). Include one short grounding sentence: "Start there." "That's enough." "Trust this."

5. BANNED: Do not start with "In today's world", "Since ancient times", or "Throughout history". Do not use "delve", "harness the power", "transformative journey", "unlock your potential", or "comprehensive".

6. LENGTH: Keep between 80-120 words. Warm but efficient.
