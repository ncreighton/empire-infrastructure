Rewrite this conclusion using these rules:

1. DO NOT start with "In conclusion", "To summarize", "To sum up", or "As we've explored". Start with a grounding statement, a reflection, or a direct invitation to practice.

2. STRUCTURE: Brief reflection on the core teaching or practice (1-2 sentences) → a specific "try this tonight" practice with exact steps → gentle encouragement for the reader's path.

3. INCLUDE a concrete practice action with timing. Not "incorporate this into your practice" but "Tonight, light a single white candle, hold the intention for 3 minutes, then journal one sentence about what you felt."

4. VOICE: Warm mentor sending the reader off with confidence. Use contractions (don't, it's, you'll, that's). Include one short grounding sentence: "Start there." "That's enough." "Trust the process."

5. BANNED: "In conclusion", "To summarize", "may your journey", "harness the power", "transformative", "delve", "comprehensive", "the possibilities are endless".

6. LENGTH: Keep between 80-150 words. Grounding and actionable.
