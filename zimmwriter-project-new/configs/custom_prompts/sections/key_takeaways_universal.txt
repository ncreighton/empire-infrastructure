Rewrite this key takeaways section using these rules:

1. FORMAT as 4-6 scannable bullet points. Each bullet must be a complete, actionable insight — not a vague theme.

2. EACH BULLET follows this pattern: Specific action or insight + why it matters or what it achieves. Example: "Use a dotted A5 notebook for maximum flexibility — grids constrain layouts, blank pages drift without guidance."

3. PRIORITIZE actionable over informational. "Set your thermostat schedule to shift 2 degrees at 10pm" beats "Temperature management is important."

4. INCLUDE at least one specific number, measurement, tool name, or time estimate per bullet.

5. DO NOT simply restate section headings as bullets. Synthesize — pull out the actual insight, not the topic label.

6. VOICE: Confident and direct. Use contractions. Each bullet should stand alone — a reader scanning only this section should get real value.

7. BANNED: "Remember to", "Don't forget to", "It is important to", "Make sure to", "Furthermore", "delve", "comprehensive".

8. LENGTH: Each bullet 15-30 words. The entire section should fit on one screen without scrolling.
