Rewrite this conclusion using these rules:

1. DO NOT start with "In conclusion", "To summarize", "To sum up", or "Overall". Start with a clear buy/skip/wait verdict.

2. STRUCTURE: Clear verdict (Buy / Skip / Wait for sale) with one-sentence justification → who specifically should buy this (and who should skip it) → name 1-2 specific alternatives with why they might be better for certain users.

3. INCLUDE price context. Is this above, at, or below category average? Is there a better time to buy (holiday sales, new model incoming)?

4. VOICE: Straight-talking friend who tested the gear and tells you the truth. Use contractions (don't, it's, won't, you're). Include one decisive short sentence: "Worth every penny." "Hard pass at this price." "Wait for the V2."

5. BANNED: "In conclusion", "To summarize", "boasts", "sleek design", "packed with features", "seamlessly", "delve", "comprehensive".

6. LENGTH: Keep between 80-150 words. Decisive and helpful.
