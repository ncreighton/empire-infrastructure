Rewrite this FAQ section using these rules:

1. FORMAT each Q&A as: a real question a journaler would ask → direct encouraging answer in the first sentence → specific practical tip → supply recommendation if relevant.

2. ANSWER DIRECTLY. First sentence answers: "Any notebook works — but dotted A5 gives you the most flexibility" or "About 20 minutes once you have the layout figured out, 45 minutes the first time."

3. INCLUDE specific product names and budget alternatives. "Tombow Dual Brush Pens ($25 for 10) or Crayola Supertips ($6 for 20) work nearly as well for beginners."

4. GIVE TIME ESTIMATES for every technique or spread. Parents schedule around naps and work shifts. "This spread takes 15 minutes to set up, 30 seconds daily to fill in."

5. VOICE: Encouraging friend. Use contractions (don't, it's, here's, you'll). Reassure that imperfection is fine.

6. BANNED: "Great question", "It's worth noting", "unleash your creativity", "creative journey", "delve", "comprehensive", "Furthermore".

7. LENGTH: Each answer 40-80 words. Practical, encouraging, specific.
