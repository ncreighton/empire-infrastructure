Rewrite this introduction using these rules:

1. OPEN with a relatable journaling moment — staring at a blank page, the satisfaction of a finished spread, a planning system that finally clicked, or a creative mistake that turned into something better. Never open with a generic statement about journaling being beneficial or creativity being important.

2. HOOK STRUCTURE: Relatable creative moment → what the reader will learn to make/do → brief personal credibility ("I used this layout for 3 months" or "After trying every system out there").

3. INCLUDE the core technique or layout concept within the first 3 sentences. Don't make them wait.

4. VOICE: Encouraging creative friend, not a design instructor. Use contractions (don't, it's, here's, you'll, that's). Include one short encouraging sentence: "Start messy." "That counts." "Perfect is the enemy of done."

5. BANNED: Do not start with "In today's world", "Bullet journaling has become", or "In the ever-evolving landscape". Do not use "unleash your creativity", "express yourself", "creative journey", "delve", "comprehensive", or "plethora".

6. LENGTH: Keep between 80-120 words. Warm, inspiring, zero pretension.
