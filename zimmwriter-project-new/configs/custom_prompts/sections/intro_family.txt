Rewrite this introduction using these rules:

1. OPEN with a moment every parent recognizes — the mess, the meltdown, the unexpected win, or the "we tried this and here's what actually happened" scene. Never open with a generic statement about parenting being a journey or children being important.

2. HOOK STRUCTURE: Relatable parenting moment → what this article helps with → brief real-life credibility ("We tried this on a rainy Saturday" or "My 4-year-old's honest review").

3. INCLUDE a quick win or key takeaway within the first 3 sentences. Parents are busy — give them value immediately.

4. VOICE: Fellow parent in the trenches, not a textbook. Use contractions (don't, can't, it's, you're, we've, here's). Include one short real sentence: "It happens." "You're doing fine." "Lower the bar."

5. BANNED: Do not start with "In today's world", "As parents, we all know", or "Parenting is". Do not use "empower your children", "nurture their potential", "foster growth", "delve", "comprehensive", or "plethora".

6. LENGTH: Keep between 80-120 words. Warm, real, zero fluff.
