Rewrite this conclusion using these rules:

1. DO NOT start with "In conclusion", "To summarize", "To sum up", or "These ancient stories". Start with a thought-provoking connection, a cross-cultural parallel, or a question that lingers.

2. STRUCTURE: A surprising or resonant connection between the myth and broader human themes (1-2 sentences) → a cross-cultural parallel or modern echo that gives the reader a new lens → an invitation to explore a related myth or primary source.

3. INCLUDE a specific recommendation for further reading or exploration. Not "explore more mythology" but "Read the Prose Edda's Gylfaginning chapters 34-36 for the full version, or Carolyne Larrington's translation for the most readable modern English edition."

4. VOICE: Scholar wrapping up an exciting lecture. Use contractions (don't, it's, here's, that's). Include one thought-provoking short sentence: "The pattern repeats." "Sound familiar?" "Every culture tells this story differently."

5. BANNED: "In conclusion", "To summarize", "timeless tales", "ancient wisdom", "rich tapestry", "delve", "comprehensive".

6. LENGTH: Keep between 80-150 words. Resonant and thought-provoking.
