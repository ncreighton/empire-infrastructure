Rewrite this meta description using these rules:

1. LENGTH: Exactly 145-155 characters including spaces. Google truncates at ~155. Too short wastes SERP real estate.

2. STRUCTURE: Benefit or hook (what the reader gets) + specificity signal (number, year, or qualifier) + action verb or CTA.

3. INCLUDE at least one of: a specific number ("7 tested methods"), a year ("2025 guide"), a qualifier ("step-by-step", "beginner-friendly"), or a benefit ("save 3 hours").

4. FRONT-LOAD the value. The first 60 characters are the most visible on mobile SERPs. Put the most compelling element first.

5. USE active voice and second person ("you" / "your"). Make the reader the protagonist.

6. BANNED: "In this article", "Read on to discover", "Learn more about", "This comprehensive guide", "delve", "explore". These waste characters and add no value.

7. DO NOT stuff keywords unnaturally. One natural inclusion of the primary topic is enough.

8. END with implicit CTA: "...here's what actually works" or "...with real test data" — something that creates a click impulse.
